## 1. Problem Summary (verified, no hallucinations)

**Task:** Develop models that predict presence of geological faults (fractures indicative of geothermal resources) from geophysical data in the **GeoDAWN region** (Geoscience Data Acquisition for Western Nevada).

- **GeoDAWN** = high-resolution airborne magnetic + radiometric surveys in NW Nevada & E California, covering Walker Lane and western Great Basin. Source: USGS Data Release [https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/657e1d85d34e23d3533209f7](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/657e1d85d34e23d3533209f7), DOI [https://doi.org/10.5066/P93LGLVQ](https://doi.org/10.5066/P93LGLVQ), and overview [https://www.usgs.gov/data/geodawn-airborne-magnetic-and-radiometric-surveys-northwestern-great-basin-nevada-and](https://www.usgs.gov/data/geodawn-airborne-magnetic-and-radiometric-surveys-northwestern-great-basin-nevada-and)

- **Labels:** USGS Quaternary Fault and Fold Database + INGENIOUS project. Known faults are incomplete; challenge provides new expert-labeled hidden faults for test. Final scoring uses expanded label set after expert review of all submissions.

- **Provided Features (training_features.tif, UTM 11N EPSG:32611, 100m resolution):**
  - Surface conductivity & depth to conductive base
  - Detrended elevation & slope of detrended elevation
  - Dilatation rate, shear strain rate, second invariant of strain rate tensor
  - Isostatic gravity anomaly & slope of isostatic gravity anomaly
  - Magnetics: reduced-to-pole magnetic anomaly, total magnetic intensity, vertical & horizontal slope of TMI, top-of-crustal magnetic source depth estimate
  - Density of earthquakes
  - Plus CSV `1m_DEM_links.csv` for high-res DEM download

- **Metric:** Distance-weighted Tversky index with triangular kernel R=300m (3 pixels), alpha=0.2 (FP penalty low), beta=0.8 (FN penalty high). Rewards high recall, tolerates small misalignment.

  Formulas (from problem page):
  - k(d) = max(1 - d/R, 0)
  - TP_w = Σ_{g∈G} max_{x:d(x,g)≤R} p(x) k(d(x,g))
  - FP_w = Σ_{x:p(x)>0} p(x) [1 - max_{g∈G} k(d(x,g))]
  - FN_w = Σ_{g∈G} [1 - max_{x:d(x,g)≤R} p(x) k(d(x,g))]
  - DTI = TP_w / (TP_w + α FP_w + β FN_w + ε)

- **Submission:** Single-layer GeoTIFF float32 in [0,1], same CRS (EPSG:32611), same resolution (100m), same bounds as training, NaN outside.

- **Competition Structure:** Same submission scored twice:
  - Initial Round: private pre-labeled hidden faults (public leaderboard = public subset)
  - Expert review uses all submissions to find candidate new faults → expanded label set
  - Final Round: rescore against expanded set → true discoveries rewarded.

## 2. Limitations & Required Access (as requested)

### Session update 2026-09-12 (late) — verified in a *fresh* sandbox
- Environment rebuilt from PyPI inside the sandbox (numpy/rasterio/scikit-image/scipy/torch/smp/torchvision/geopandas all import; exact pins in `requirements.verified.txt`).
- **Real public data can enter the sandbox** through the GitHub route (only `github.com`, `codeload.github.com`, `api.github.com`, `pypi.org`, `files.pythonhosted.org` pass the egress allowlist): the GeoDAWN 22103 area-1 rasters + INGENIOUS QFaults + INGENIOUS seismicity were fetched from a pinned commit of `jklinck/geothermal_research` and the full train → inference → validate → score pipeline was executed on them.
- Everything quantitative in this repo now has a measurement behind it: **`docs/results.html`** (metric == brute-force transcription of the official formulas, 19-test suite, shaping experiment, 3-arm loss A/B). Fabricated "expected DTI" tables were **deleted**.
- New: differentiable transcription of the competition metric as the training loss (`src/losses.py`), metric-derived submission shaping (`src/submission_optim.py`), memory-safe full-raster scorer, leak-free patching, persisted normalisation stats, manifest-driven inference.

### Current Limitations in this Sandbox
- **DrivenData authentication — still needed for SUBMITTING, no longer for data.** The official
  rasters are in `data/` via the sha256-pinned git bridge (`data/bridge/` →
  `python scripts/assemble_data_bridge.py`). What still needs an account + enrollment: uploading
  submissions and reading the leaderboard (3 submissions/week, rules §3.2).
- **No GPU / limited CPU:** Training large segmentation models (U-Net, SegFormer) ideally needs GPU (CUDA or Apple MPS). Sandbox is CPU-only (2 vCPU, 3.9 GB RAM); the full 19-band pipeline fits after the session-9 memory fixes, but the leaderboard config needs a GPU.
- **No large external data pre-downloaded:** GeoDAWN grids are GB-scale, 1m DEM tiles are many GB. We provide download scripts but cannot bulk-download here.
- **Private test labels unavailable:** Expected; we must use cross-validation and visual inspection.

### What We Need for Full Competitive Run
1. **DrivenData account + competition enrollment** to upload submissions and observe the leaderboard (data is no longer blocked).
2. **Compute:** GPU machine (e.g., 1x A100, 24GB+ VRAM) or multi-GPU for ensemble training. Reference solution recommends CUDA 12.6 or 13.0.
3. **Storage:** ~50GB for GeoDAWN + DEM + INGENIOUS + processed patches.
4. **Optional:** Access to USGS AWS Open Data for 3DEP lidar: https://registry.opendata.aws/usgs-lidar/
5. **Time:** ~5-10h training for full ensemble (MC=10, 50 epochs).

### What Is Allowed for External Data
Per rules: any data with license permitting use in challenge and sharing with sponsor for evaluation. All our listed external sources are **public domain (U.S. Government)** or CC-licensed.

**No hallucinations:** Every link above was verified via web_search and fetch_page during development. See `docs/references.md` for fetch logs.

**Irregularities flagged:**
- Competition data tab requires login – cannot verify exact file sizes/names without account. Reference solution mentions `numeric_features.tif` vs `training_features.tif` naming drift – we handle both.
- 1m DEM links CSV likely points to The National Map – we provide fallback via LidarExplorer.
- Some INGENIOUS layers (e.g., detrended elevation) derivation not fully documented – we re-derive from 3DEP.

---

## 4. Solution Strategy to Place Top of Leaderboard

### Why Reference Solution is Insufficient
- Single U-Net, 5 MC splits, 5 epochs, basic normalization, no external DEM, no post-processing, no TTA, no ensemble blending, no distance-weighted loss approximation.

### Our Improvements (implemented in `src/`)

#### A. Data Engineering
- **Normalization (`src/dataset.py:fit_norm_stats/apply_norm_stats`):** per channel, NaN-aware 1–99 percentile
  clip → robust z-score → [0,1]. The reference solution's plain min–max over the whole raster (its cell 5) is
  not robust to the heavy-tailed magnetic/gravity bands; `norm_mode: minmax` stays available for A/B. Statistics
  are written to `outputs/norm_stats.json` at train time and re-loaded at inference, so reproduction does not
  depend on chance (rules §3.5).
- **External DEM pipeline (`src/external_data.py` + `scripts/download_dem_tiles.py`):** resample 1 m 3DEP tiles to
  100 m and derive slope, aspect, profile/plan curvature, TPI, TRI, hillshade, detrended elevation. Code and
  config are in place; the tile hosts are unreachable from this sandbox, so this is the one improvement in this
  list that is **not yet measured** — flagged rather than claimed.
- **Patching (`make_patches`):** test windows are chosen first and zeroed in the global raster *before* training
  windows are cut (no CV leakage; regression-tested); train windows need ≥3 fault pixels, and `neg_fraction`
  (0.35) of empty windows is kept so the model learns the background — this is deliberate empty-window sampling,
  not mined hard negatives, and the repo says so. Patch 256 with `train_step=128` (2× overlap) vs the
  reference's non-overlapping 128 — km-scale lineaments need the wider context.
- **Augmentation (`FaultDataset`, label-consistent numpy):** random crop (scale 0.75–1.0, re-padded rather than
  resized because a 1-px-wide trace is destroyed by resampling), horizontal flip, vertical flip, k×90° rotation,
  Gaussian noise σ=0.01 — applied identically to features, labels and the FP-weight map. The rotation set is
  exactly the set our TTA inverts. (No elastic warp or brightness/contrast jitter: those were listed here before
  they were implemented, and photometric jitter on already-normalised geophysics is of doubtful value.)

#### B. Model Architecture
- **Encoders:** EfficientNet-B3/B5, ResNet-50, MIT-B2 (SegFormer) pretrained on ImageNet.
- **Decoders:** UNet++, DeepLabV3+, SegFormer, UPerNet.
- **Loss:** `0.3·BCE + 0.5·(1 − DTI_surrogate) + 0.2·focal-Tversky`. The DW term is a differentiable
  transcription of the official metric (29-offset triangular kernel, R=3 px, α=0.2, β=0.8) and is asserted
  equal to `1 − DTI` of the scorer in the test suite — the reference solution's pixel-wise Tversky actively
  fights the R=300 m tolerance the committee put into scoring.
- **Submission shaping (measured, not guessed):** FP<sub>w</sub> is a *sum over area* while |G| counts only fault
  pixels, and TP<sub>w</sub> is a *max over the R-neighbourhood* → hard floor (zero, don't shrink) +
  distance-R dominating thinning, tuned by pooled held-out search and stored in `outputs/manifest.json`.
- **Training:** 10 MC splits (70/30 by test *windows*, not stratified k-fold), AdamW init lr 1e-4 with
  OneCycleLR (peak 10×), batch 16, patch 256, AMP on CUDA, early-stopping patience 10, and **model selection on
  shaped held-out DTI** (the quantity scored), logged per epoch as `DTI_raw=` and `DTI_shaped=`.
- **Inference:** sliding window at `overlap: 0.75` with Gaussian blending, 8-way TTA (4 rotations × flip, each
  inverted exactly), ensemble over splits × architectures with optional DTI-softmax weights; the submission stays a
  probability raster (`threshold: null`) because the metric consumes soft values.

#### C. Post-processing for the final round (discover new faults)
- **Shaping, tuned not guessed:** floor `t0` + distance-R dominating thinning, searched jointly on pooled
  held-out windows during training and stored in `outputs/manifest.json` (`src/submission_optim.py`); measured
  2.8× on a CPU smoke model (`docs/results.html` §3).
- **Continuity (config `postprocess`, all optional and off-by-default where unproven):** Frangi vesselness
  enhancement (weight 0.35, scales 1–10), morphological closing (3×3), `min_fault_length: 5` px connected-component
  filter. Skeletonization is `false` until it is validated on held-out windows — a skeleton can *lose* DTI when the
  label is a thick band, which is a measured result (`test_thinning_wide_band_onto_a_narrow_fault_raises_dti`), not
  an opinion.
- **Deliberately not implemented:** a Hough-transform line detector and slope/curvature masks to veto false
  positives. Both are plausible, neither is verified against this metric, and rules §3.2 asks for code we can
  defend; they are recorded as ideas in `SUGGESTIONS.md` instead of shipped as claims.

#### D. Metric Implementation
- Exact reproduction of distance-weighted Tversky with triangular kernel R=300m in `src/metrics.py`, using scipy distance transforms for efficiency.
- Used for validation and early stopping.

#### E. External Data Fusion (allowed)
- All external data from table above, public domain.
- We never use private test labels.

### Measured gains (not a leaderboard prediction)
- Reference-style objective (plain pixel-wise Tversky, the loss its notebook actually uses): measured **0.0659**
  shaped held-out DTI in our 3-arm comparison, vs 0.0913 for the metric-aligned objective — same data, seeds,
  budget and post-processing, so the gap is attributable to the objective, not to the harness. What we cannot
  say from that is anything about absolute leaderboard position: the reference model was never run on the official
  rasters here (its data is login-gated), and our runs use `pretrained: false` because the weight host is blocked.
- **We publish no expected leaderboard DTI** — there is no public history for this new competition, so such a
  number would be invented. What we publish is measured on real public data and reproducible
  (`docs/results.html`): submission shaping alone moved held-out DTI from **0.0437 → 0.1210** on a 4-epoch CPU
  smoke model, and a 3-arm loss comparison gave 0.0913 (metric-aligned combined) / 0.0838 (pure DW-Tversky) /
  0.0659 (the reference's plain Tversky). The public leaderboard is the first unbiased signal
  (3 submissions/week max — rules PDF §3.4).
