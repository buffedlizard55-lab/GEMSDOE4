## Session 34 (2026-09-26) — implemented first, queued second

| # | Suggestion | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **A sweep must select on the scope it claims to select on.** `combine_newfault.py` ranked by the whole-grid proxy DTI while its own report said "the selection fold's blocks"; `newfault_detector.py`'s `sweep(scope_mask, …)` accepted a scope mask and never used it. | ✅ Fixed in both. Four scopes per candidate, `SELECTION_KEY = "proxy_dti_selection"` is the only key that picks, `None` stops the run instead of ranking as zero, report names each scope. 12 + 16 tests. |
| 2 | **A search must be able to express the winning hypothesis.** `--votes` defaulted to `1,2`, so the k = 3 family (best generalising family on the untouched fold) was outside the search space. | ✅ Default `1,2,3,4,5`; an impossible k is refused by name; the report records what was ASKED for (`k_votes_swept`) separately from what ran. New test. |
| 3 | **Disclose the union's fold discipline per member, from each member's own report, instead of asserting it.** Session 33's report text said folds 0+1 were "the two folds the NFF members never trained on"; that is false for the two members run with `--fold 2 --eval-fold 3`. | ✅ `selection.fold_discipline` is computed from each member's `report.json` (clean / in-sample / no-protocol), the site renders it, and `summary`/`scope_message` no longer type the claim. |
| 4 | **Quantify the in-sample exposure, with a control.** A raw fold comparison proves nothing because folds differ in difficulty. | ✅ `scripts/audit_fold_discipline.py`: common policy, difference-in-differences, control group = members whose own holdout IS the union's folds. +0.0543 DTI estimated exposure; the symmetry assumption is written into the JSON. 2 tests. |
| 5 | **Keep a control arm where no member is in-sample, and commit its artifact too.** | ✅ `data/evidence/combined_clean/` (4 clean members, 200 candidates, validator-passing raster). It shows every level is lower AND that the selection-fold argmax can miss the untouched fold by 2.6×. |
| 6 | **Turn the metric into a budget.** The metric collapses to `DTI = TP_w / (α(TP_w + FP_w) + β\|G\| + ε)`, so "what would a higher target cost" is arithmetic. | ✅ `scripts/emission_budget.py` + `tests/test_emission_budget.py` (6 tests); `data/evidence/emission_budget.json`; rendered on `results.html`. |
| 7 | **Train on the metric's own tolerance region.** The scorer credits any prediction within R = 3 px, so the target is "a fault within 300 m of this pixel", not "this pixel is a fault". | ✅ `--corridor PX` on the detector, using `src.metrics.kernel_offsets` as the structuring element (a 3-iteration default dilation is a diamond: it credits 300 m but not 283 m). 2 tests pin the disk geometry. |
| 8 | **Commit the reference raster a contrast is paired against.** `data/evidence/union_po_loo/prev_committed_*.tif` was gitignored, so a fresh clone could not re-run the contrast it cites. | ✅ `.gitignore` exception added; this session's reference (`c1da7dd9…`, the k = 2 artifact) is now committed. |
| 9 | Render the pooled adoption contrast on the site (session 33 item 10). | ✅ Done — plus the selection-scope table, the fold-discipline audit, the clean-pool control and the emission budget, all read from evidence JSON at build time, with the pre-fix state rendering an explicit "this report predates the fix" note instead of a column of zeros. |
| 10 | Upload the artifact and record a real score. `main` now ships `237f0063…` (k = 3 of 5, clean-fold proxy 0.2221). | ⏳ **HUMAN — the highest-value action available.** Note: `nff-k3-fold0-selected · union k=3 of 5 members (t0=0.124, w=0)`. |
| 11 | **Re-run `nff43` and `nff45` under the fixed detector path** (`--fold 0 --eval-fold 1`), so the 5-member pool has no in-sample member. Their `prob_raw.tif` fields are unchanged and committed; only the policy sweep changed. | ⏳ **QUEUED, next session, cheap: ~5 min of fit + ~4.5 min of grid prediction each on 2 vCPU.** Then re-run `combine_newfault.py` and the audit — this is the falsifier that would promote the clean pool from control to shipped. |
| 12 | Alternatively / additionally: a `proxy_only` member on folds 2/3, so BOTH fold pairs have a proxy-only member and the pool can be swapped rather than rebuilt. | ⏳ Queued. Pre-register first; session 31 measured that extra members of the same supervision make the union *worse*. |
| 13 | **Select on a less noisy statistic.** The clean-pool arm's single-fold argmax (k = 4) missed the untouched fold by 2.6× while the k = 2/k = 3 families were within 0.002 of their selection value. | ⏳ Queued, pre-register before running: argmax over `proxy_dti_pooled01`, or a 1-standard-error band on the selection fold, with the choice frozen in advance. |
| 14 | A third partition seed. Every committed run uses seed 42, so the partition-dependence falsifier in `docs/SESSION34_PROTOCOL.md` §4 has never been exercised. | ⏳ Queued — `--seed` is already plumbed through the combiner, the detector and the audit. |

**Next session queue (priority order):**
1. **Upload `237f0063…` and record the real score** (human, 1 of 3 this week) — file
   `data/evidence/combined/submission.tif` (505,882 B; the browser-built copy is verifiable against
   `docs/submission_meta.json`), Note `nff-k3-fold0-selected · union k=3 of 5 members (t0=0.124, w=0)`.
2. Re-run `nff43` / `nff45` with `--fold 0 --eval-fold 1` (item 11) and re-audit; if the pool's clean
   members then support k = 3 as well, the shipped artifact's measurement stops being in-sample for
   anyone.
3. Pre-register and run the less-noisy selector (item 13) on the clean pool.
4. Everything still standing from session 33's queue (upload, DriveData account, GPU training).

## Session 33 (2026-09-26) — main unbroken, the adoption's interval made readable, and two silent-overwrite defects closed

| # | Suggestion | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **`main` must not be red.** CI run 36209417841 failed on `test_the_build_reproduces_the_committed_pages: ['how_to_submit.html']`; PR #7 re-ran the generator check but never rebuilt the site, so the page a human uses to submit still described the *previous* artifact (548,834 B / `19de9950…` / 299,708 B). | ✅ Site rebuilt; the page now renders `c1da7dd9…` / 547,082 B / 298,364 B. 4/4 site-page tests. |
| 2 | **A weaker checkout must not be able to publish a weaker page.** `check_submission_readiness.py` overwrote the committed PASS record with `MISSING` for `data_placed` + `preflight` in a checkout without the gitignored 418 MB stack — the same failure `verify_links.py` already guards against. | ✅ Same guard: refuses and exits 3, prints the per-gate comparison, `--allow-degraded` overrides, a genuine `FAIL` always writes. Measured both paths. |
| 3 | **Queue item 3 from session 32: pooled multi-fold paired contrast** (cross the 12-block readable-CI bar). | ✅ Done, with the trap found first: `newfault_detector.py:336-341` trains on everything except folds 0 and 1, so folds 2/3 are IN-SAMPLE. The honest pool is **folds 0+1: 0.233098 → 0.247454, Δ +0.014356, P = 1.0, CI95 [+0.0080, +0.0202] over 17 blocks** — vs the in-sample pool's +0.026337, which is committed as an upper bound only. |
| 4 | **`--fold` should accept a list, and every pooled file should say which folds the sweep/training saw.** | ✅ `--fold 2,3` + `--note`; `folds`, `fold_note`, `per_fold` in the JSON; a doubled comma or an out-of-range fold is refused rather than silently dropped. |
| 5 | **The adoption's own evidence file reported `n_scoreable_blocks: 0` for the winning arm.** | ✅ Candidate rows now carry the truth's `scoreable`/`n_gt`; pinned by a test. DTIs/CI/P were unaffected (the bootstrap reads TP_w/FP_w/FN_w only). |
| 6 | **The script an adoption decision rests on had zero tests.** | ✅ `tests/test_paired_contrast.py`, 15 tests. |
| 7 | **Re-verify the file to be uploaded before asking a human to spend one of 3 weekly submissions on it.** | ✅ Validator PASSED 10/10 (incl. the three range/NaN checks), generator verdict PASS 8/10, readiness 6 PASS / 0 FAIL / 1 HUMAN. |
| 8 | Upload `nff-po-drop-nff42` and record the real score. | ⏳ HUMAN — unchanged, still the highest-value action available. |
| 9 | `docs/submission.html` still renders a live reading of `data/` ("MATCHES THE PIN" vs "ABSENT"), so the published page states a fact about whichever machine built it. This session had to `git checkout` that one page to avoid publishing my sandbox's state. | ⏳ next session — render the committed `data/evidence/data_placement.json` as the primary column and keep the live check as an extra one; then the `LIVE_STATE_MARKERS` exception in `tests/test_site_pages.py` can shrink. |
| 10 | Render the pooled adoption contrast on the site. `scripts/build_site.py` does not read `data/evidence/union_po_loo/contrasts/*` at all, so the strongest number in the repository is currently in a JSON file and not on any page. | ⏳ next session — one table on `docs/results.html` (per-fold rows + the honest pool + the in-sample pool labelled as such), pinned by a test like `tests/test_site.py`. |
| 11 | Second `proxy_only` member on folds 2/3 (session-32 queue item 2). | ⏳ blocked here on the 418 MB bridge (`fetch_bridge_parts.py`; `raw.githubusercontent.com` is TLS-blocked in this sandbox, `gh api` is not). **Pre-register first**, and note the session-31 result: extra members of the same supervision made the union *worse*. |

**Next session queue (priority order):**
1. **Upload `nff-po-drop-nff42` and record the real score** (human, 1 of 3 this week) — file
   `data/evidence/combined/submission.tif` (sha256 `c1da7dd9…`, 547,082 B; the browser-built copy
   is pixel-identical), Note `nff-po-drop-nff42 · proxy_only diversity · union k=2 of 5
   (t0=0.18, w=0)`. This is the second surrogate→board calibration point; without it every
   number here stays a surrogate.
2. **Publish the pooled contrast on `docs/results.html`** (item 10) — cheap, and it is the
   difference between "we measured it" and "a reader can see we measured it".
3. **Make `docs/submission.html` render the committed placement record** (item 9) so no future
   session has to hand-restore a page.
4. **An honest pooled contrast that includes genuinely untouched geography**: retrain the NFF
   members holding out folds 2/3 (`--fold 2 --eval-fold 3`) so all four folds are out-of-sample
   for *some* member set; needs the bridge + ~15 min CPU per member.
5. **Second `proxy_only` member** (item 11), pre-registered, then re-run the LOO + adoption
   protocol unchanged.
6. **DEM derivatives** and **GPU full-config** — unchanged blockers (unrestricted egress + ~50 GB;
   no GPU in any sandbox so far).

## Session 32 (2026-09-26) — diversity from supervision, not seeds: adopted

| # | Suggestion | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **A third truth source for member diversity** (session-31 queue item 2). QFaults refused. | ✅ **Done via proxy_only** — `--supervision proxy_only` trains on SGMC code-2 only. LOO adopts drop-nff42 (keep po46): meas 0.1996, P=1.0 vs committed 0.1897. |
| 2 | Recover classical baseline so the union is clone-reproducible. | ✅ sha `9f2577cf…` restored from GEMSDOE via gh api; now git-tracked. |
| 3 | Place competition data in this sandbox. | ✅ bridge parts via `gh api` (raw.githubusercontent.com still TLS-blocked); prepare_data PASS. |
| 4 | Unique submission name + Note. | ✅ `nff-po-drop-nff42 · proxy_only diversity · union k=2 of 5 (t0=0.18, w=0)`. |
| 5 | Leaderboard upload of the adopted union. | ⏳ HUMAN — 1 of 3 this week. Turns the one-point surrogate calibration into two. |
| 6 | DEM derivatives. | ⏳ unchanged (needs unrestricted egress + ~50 GB). |
| 7 | GPU full-config. | ⏳ unchanged. |
| 8 | Second proxy_only member on a different fold pair (e.g. folds 2/3, seed 47) for further diversity. | ⏳ next-session candidate; pre-register before training. |
| 9 | Pooled 4-fold paired contrast of the adoption (cross the 12-block readable-CI bar). | ⏳ next session; needs scoring on folds 0/2/3 of both fields. |

**Next session queue (priority order):**
1. **Upload `nff-po-drop-nff42` and record the real score** (human, 1 of 3 this week) — file `data/evidence/combined/submission.tif` (or the browser-built copy), Note `nff-po-drop-nff42 · proxy_only diversity · union k=2 of 5 (t0=0.18, w=0)`.
2. **Second proxy_only member** on folds 2/3 (seed 47), then re-run LOO + adoption unchanged.
3. **Pooled multi-fold paired contrast** of the adopted vs previous field (≥12 blocks).
4. **DEM derivatives** — unchanged (needs unrestricted egress + ~50 GB).
5. **GPU full-config** — unchanged.

## Session 31 (2026-09-25) — member diversity measured honestly: two members in, one better member set out

| # | Suggestion | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **More NFF members are the cheapest gain** (the session-26 queue, item 3). | ⚠️ **Measured, and the naive version is FALSE** — two pre-registered members (`nff44` neg-ratio 5, `nff45` neg-ratio 20) made every 6-member union worse on the measurement fold (0.1590 coarse / 0.1692 fine vs 0.1747). Same features + same truth ⇒ correlated errors: extra members add FP mass faster than coverage. The gain came from the leave-one-out: **drop `nff44`, adopt k = 2 of 5** (`data/evidence/union6_loo/drop_nff44/report.json`). |
| 2 | The floor grid (9 geometric steps) was hiding the k-of-n family; the 4-member sweep never searched votes. | ✅ Adopted — `--floors 18 --votes 1,2` on the same folds/seed; the k = 2 family leads the selection fold (0.2096, 0.1993 before the best k = 1 at 0.1832). The adopted policy is k = 2 of 5 at t0 = 0.180482. |
| 3 | Adoption decisions should carry a paired probability, not two point estimates. | ✅ Implemented — `scripts/paired_union_contrast.py`: per-block decomposition + `bootstrap_from_blocks`, with a refuse-to-run identity guard (per-block sums must recompose to `score_within_mask` within 1e-9). Measured: P(cand > ref) = **0.957**, contrast CI95 [−0.0030, +0.0232], **9 blocks — COARSE, disclosed everywhere the number appears**. |
| 4 | Data placement was believed to need "any unrestricted machine". | ✅ Closed for THIS sandbox — `raw.githubusercontent.com` is TLS-blocked, but the GitHub API is not: `gh api repos/…/contents/… -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.raw"` restores the pinned parts, then `fetch_bridge_parts.py --check` verifies all five sha256 pins. Placed + prepared in-sandbox for the first time. |
| 5 | Session-30 open item: a "Build it here" link from the site root. | ✅ Done — root `index.html` now offers the one-click builder directly (`docs/how_to_submit.html#generate-here`); its canonical URL also no longer claims to be the GEMSDOE repository. |
| 6 | Leaderboard-calibration observation (labelled heuristic, not a prediction): the two known surrogate→board pairs are deep11 (proxy 0.0999 → board 0.1563, ratio 1.56) and nothing else; the GEMSDOE2 dual-family union (board 0.1560) has no committed proxy score in this repo. If the ratio transferred at all, the adopted union's 0.1897 would land near ~0.30 — i.e. in range of the 0.3049 leader. | ⏳ Recorded as a hypothesis with ONE calibration point. The only honest test is the next upload; do not tune anything to this ratio. |

**Next session queue (priority order):**
1. **Upload `nff-union-5` and record the real score** (human, 1 of 3 this week) — file `data/evidence/combined/submission.tif` (or the browser-built copy), Note `nff-union-5 · union k=2 of 5 members (t0=0.18, w=0)`. The board score turns the one-point surrogate calibration into two, and decides whether the union line keeps leading.
2. **A third truth source for member diversity** — the failed 6-member union says diversity must come from *supervision*, not seeds: pre-register an NFF member supervised on catalogue ∪ SGMC ∪ **QFaults** (`data/evidence/xcat/qfaults_catalogue.tif`, already committed with its fetch provenance), then re-run the LOO + adoption protocol unchanged.
3. **DEM derivatives** — unchanged (needs unrestricted egress + ~50 GB; code ready).
4. **Pseudo-label self-training on the NFF line** — the session-26 trade (+0.1036 new-fault / −0.087 catalogue) is now philosophically free since the catalogue is not scored; a CPU-able variant is folding SGMC *code-2-only* weighting into `newfault_detector.py`'s sampler.
5. **GPU full-config** — unchanged (no GPU in any sandbox so far).

## Session 30 (2026-09-25) — the open item from session 23 is closed, and what it cost to close it

**Item 6 of the session-23 table is done.** `make-submission.yml` has now run on a real runner, more
than once, and its committed evidence is real rather than null. Run **36188417233** on `main`
@ `a16dc83` is **success**: steps 7 (place the rasters), 8 (re-hash + re-validate), 11 (site payload
consistency), 12 (site rebuild), 13 (package) and 14 (refuse to publish nothing) all ran and passed,
and `data/evidence/make_submission/36188417233.json` records `submission_sha256 932c2f30…`
(793,704 B), `validator_passed true`, `payload_check true`, `generator_verdict PASS`,
`committed_artifact_unchanged true`.

Getting there took four merges, and each failure was found by *reading the runner result* rather than
assuming green — which is the transferable lesson, not the specific bugs:

| # | Suggestion | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Treat a workflow's own diagnostic text as a claim to be checked, not as truth.** Route A printed `MISSING $ART (it is committed; …)` for a path `git ls-files` says is not committed. The message was wrong, and it was wrong for the same reason the step failed. | ✅ Implemented — `tests/test_workflow_yaml.py::test_every_evidence_raster_a_workflow_reads_is_available_to_it` asserts every `data/evidence/**/*.tif` a workflow reads is in git's index **or** produced by an earlier step of the same workflow. Comments are stripped and `--out`/`-o`/redirect targets count as produced, so it has no false alarms. |
| 2 | **A guard that cannot fail is worse than no guard.** The sidecar check compared against `submission.tif.sha256`, a filename that never exists, so it silently never ran; `proxy-eval.yml` scored an uncommitted raster behind an always-false `if [ -f ]` and emitted a warning while going green. | ✅ Fixed — `${ART%.tif}.sha256`; `proxy-eval.yml` scores the shipped artifact. `committed_artifact_unchanged: true` in run 36188417233 is the first time that guard has actually executed. |
| 3 | **Make "is the input present?" a different question from "is the manifest present?"** The workflows decided whether the bridge existed by testing for `manifest.json`, so an incomplete bridge took the local-assembly branch and failed. | ✅ Implemented — `scripts/fetch_bridge_parts.py` restores the parts from a **commit-sha-pinned** mirror and verifies every sha256; `--check` is the no-network probe that answers the real question. |
| 4 | **Pin the artefact you download to a commit, and prove the bytes.** A branch-named mirror would make a sha256-pinned artefact depend on a moving target. | ✅ Implemented + measured — `data/bridge/mirror.json` pins `cceebbdcf9a7d2890bb0665defcb54dfc66ae452`; all five parts match their manifest pins and reassemble to 418,912,844 B / sha256 `4371c82e…`, the whole-file pin. |
| 5 | A "Build it here" link from the site root. | ⏳ Still open, cosmetic — the generator is reachable only from `how_to_submit.html`. |
| 6 | Run `make-submission.yml` on a real runner and read its evidence. | ✅ **Done** — four runs read, three failures root-caused and fixed, one green (36188417233). |

# Suggestions and Improvements — Implemented for Top Leaderboard

## Session 26 (2026-09-25) — GEMSDOE4: target the population the rules score, then union differently-biased detectors

| Area | What changed | Why it matters | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **The selection population was wrong, and the rules say so** | Every earlier line chose its emission policy by the *catalogue* DTI. `data/evidence/rules_quotes.json` (`phase1_target`, `phase2_target`, verified verbatim against <https://docs.nlr.gov/docs/fy26osti/96647.pdf>) scores the **expert-mapped new faults** in both prize phases; the catalogue is the training set and is scored in neither | A policy optimised on a population that is never scored is optimised on noise. This is the single highest-leverage correction available without new data | `README.md` §0.3; `scripts/newfault_detector.py` docstring quotes the sentences |
| **Lineament features (new)** | `src/lineament_features.py`: 63 features — 19 raw bands, Sato ridgeness (σ = 1/2/3) and structure-tensor coherence (σ = 1.5) on the 6 edge-signal bands, mean/std at 5 px and 11 px on 8 bands; `-3.4e38` → 0 before filtering, NaN restored after, so one NaN mask covers the whole row | A tree model can split on "this pixel is on a 2 km line"; it cannot invent that from 19 uncorrelated band values. This is the unique angle against both the shipped GPU U-Net ensemble and the existing CPU baseline | 11 tests in `tests/test_lineament_features.py`; measured 14.5 s/band for Sato at 3 σ on the full grid |
| **Independent-compilation supervision (new)** | `scripts/newfault_detector.py` trains on catalogue ∪ SGMC proxy (an independent public fault compilation), not the catalogue alone | The catalogue teaches the model the faults with the most obvious geophysical expression. The scored population is the faults the catalogue does **not** contain | `data/evidence/newfault/seed42` and `seed43`; the ablation is a flag (`--no-proxy-labels`), not a claim |
| **Selection and measurement on different geography** | `--fold` selects the emission rule by the proxy DTI over its own blocks; `--eval-fold` measures it and is never scored by the sweep; both are excluded from training with R = 3 px collars | `max()` over N noisy candidate scores is not an estimate. Measured on the real grid: selection fold proxy 0.1864, untouched measurement fold proxy 0.1747 | `data/evidence/newfault/*/report.json` → `generalisation` |
| **Detector union with a pre-registered rule (new)** | `scripts/combine_newfault.py` unions structurally different detectors and selects *how* (floor × dilation × k-of-n) on the new-fault population, inside a support window (≤ 20 % of the footprint, ≥ 1,000 px), with ineligible rows kept and explained | Coverage is cheap under this metric (FN β = 0.8 vs FP α = 0.2), so detectors with different errors are worth more together than apart. Measured on the full grid: deep ensemble proxy 0.0999 → **union 0.1864** (+87 %), while its catalogue DTI falls 0.2298 → 0.1977 | `data/evidence/combined/report.json` (every member's hash, own scores, provenance and the whole sweep) |
| **Two defects in the new code, found by re-reading it, both fixed and pinned** | (a) `build_feature_rows` used `searchsorted(..., "right")` on a chunk's upper bound, re-reading the boundary row and duplicating those pixels (706,597 rows for 704,021 requested) — a silent feature/label misalignment; (b) the NFF writer shipped the shaped field unconformed, so `floor_sharpen`'s `NaN >= t0 → False` left finite 0.0 across the whole 7.1 M-px outside-footprint region | Both are exactly the class of bug this repository exists to catch: (a) corrupts every number downstream without failing anything; (b) is the platform's own rejection message | `tests/test_newfault_detector.py` (12) and `tests/test_combine_newfault.py` (9) fail if either returns |
| **The shipping decision became one constant** | `SHIPPED_SUBMISSION` / `ARTIFACT` in `build_site.py`, `build_submission_payload.py`, `check_site_generator.py`, `check_submission_readiness.py`, `package_submission.py`; payload, site and browser generator regenerated from the union | "Which file ships" is a decision, so it should live in one auditable place rather than in prose scattered over 21 files | `data/evidence/combined/submission.tif` (793,704 B, sha256 `932c2f30…`), validator **PASSED**, generator judge **PASS** |
| **The browser generator is now artifact-agnostic** | `tests/support/generator_ui_harness.js` reads the artifact path out of the manifest it fetched instead of asserting a hard-coded directory | A test that pins the old directory would fail for the wrong reason when the shipping decision legitimately changes | harness assertion `provenance table names the artifact it reproduces` |

**Next session queue (priority order):**
1. **First leaderboard upload of the union** — human-only; 3/week, one final selection before Dec 3, 2026 11:59 PM UTC. The proxy→leaderboard transfer is the one assumption this session's numbers rest on, and only a submission can test it.
2. **DEM derivatives** — still the highest-upside detection idea; code ready (`src/external_data.py`, `scripts/download_dem_tiles.py`), needs unrestricted egress and ~50 GB.
3. **More NFF members** — each additional differently-biased detector raises the union; the marginal cost is ~15 min of CPU each, so a third and fourth seed is the cheapest available gain.
4. **Pseudo-label self-training, revisited** — previously rejected for costing catalogue DTI (−0.087) while *gaining* +0.1036 on the new-fault population. Since the catalogue is not scored, that trade is now the right way round.
5. **GPU full-config** — EfficientNet-B5, 10 MC splits, 60 epochs (`configs/config.yaml`).

## Session 22 (2026-09-22) — the union-selection signal wired into selection, and item 7's pooled reader built with a disjointness guard

| Area | What changed | Why it matters | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`training.select_on` — the union signal now drives selection, not just logging (EXEC §11 item 4)** | `src/train.py`'s early-stopping comparator, saved checkpoint and manifest `dti` now maximise whichever population `training.select_on` names (`in_domain` default / `union`). `blend_submission.py --weights dti` reads that manifest `dti`, so `union` feeds the signal into **both** early stopping and ensemble weights — the two consumers the item named | The per-epoch `DTI_union` logging (session 21) was the feed-in; without a comparator that consumes it the model was still selected on the population the leaderboard does not score. A run that asks for `union` without a proxy scope now fails fast rather than silently selecting in-domain | Fixture demo: `in_domain` picks epoch 2 (0.1206), `union` picks epoch 1 (0.1081 > 0.1015) — a real behavioural change; `tests/test_union_selection.py` (+2 tests); config keys in `configs/config_block_holdout.yaml`, `configs/config_pseudo_labels.yaml` |
| **`scripts/read_landed_reports.py --pool` — the pooled multi-fold pseudo-label contrast (EXEC §11 item 7)** | Concatenates every committed fold's two arms into ONE paired block bootstrap, recomposed from the committed per-block components (no re-scoring). Verdict names the blocker (`POOL_POSITIVE_BUT_UNDER_POWERED` when the pseudo arm exists for one fold only) | One fold has 7–9 scoreable blocks (below the scorer's 12-unit bar) and ~0.036 replicate noise that swamps the +0.0313 effect; the four folds partition the grid into disjoint block sets, so pooling is the one reading that reaches ≥12 units. The pooling workflow step (`pseudo-label.yml`) will cross 12 units once folds 1–3 fire | `data/evidence/pseudo_labels/pooled_two_population_contrast.json`; 6 new tests in `tests/test_read_landed_reports.py` |
| **The pool refuses to fake precision** | Raises if pooled block ids repeat across folds (non-disjoint → same geography resampled twice), if two folds were scored on different partitions, or if both arms record the same probability field (a contrast of a field with itself); marks the pool COARSE below 12 units | A pool that silently double-counts a region or contrasts a field with itself would manufacture confidence — the exact failure the item's ±0.036 caveat warns against | `test_pooled_contrast_refuses_non_disjoint_folds`, `..._mismatched_partitions`, `..._the_same_field_on_both_arms`, `test_pool_reproduces_the_committed_single_fold_number` |

## Session 20 (2026-09-20) — a measured gate table, a CPU-only route to an uploadable file, and four defects found by auditing claims

| Area | What changed | Why it matters | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`docs/how_to_submit.html` — the recipe as a subpage of the executive summary** | Nine sections: the gate table, the artifact with its sha256 re-hashed at build time, four routes to it, the validator gate, click-by-click upload, after-the-upload, the binding rules sentences, the CPU caveat, and a sources table | The submission is human-only, so the page IS the handover artifact — and every row on it is a measurement with a re-check command beside it | `docs/how_to_submit.html`; 15 tests in `tests/test_how_to_submit_page.py`; nav reads `Executive summary › ↳ How to submit` |
| **`scripts/check_submission_readiness.py` — the gates, measured** | Eight checks, each re-deriving its own claim (re-hash the three official rasters against the bridge pins, re-run `prepare_data.py` and hash its output, re-hash the shipped artifact against its `.sha256`, re-parse the committed validator log, re-match 29 rules quotations verbatim, read the CPU route's report, list the human-only steps, list the artifacts present) | A checklist someone typed can go stale silently. This one exits 2 on any FAIL, so it can gate a workflow; `HUMAN` is its own status rather than a PASS | `data/evidence/submission_readiness.json` — 6 PASS, 0 FAIL, 1 HUMAN, 1 MISSING→PASS once the CPU run landed |
| **`scripts/baseline_submission.py` — CPU-only, torch-free, end to end** | Histogram gradient boosting on the official 19 bands (NaN-native), features read in row chunks; writes the raster, a `.sha256` sidecar, the raw field and a report that refuses to claim competitiveness | Closes the gap where every artifact in the repo needed either a GPU or a runner: this one runs in the 2 vCPU / 3 GB sandbox in **322 s** | 545,798 B, `sha256 9f2577cf…`, 155,889 px (3.0 % of the footprint), validator **PASSED**; 29 tests |
| **The degenerate optimum, found by measurement and pre-registered out of the search** | Support cap ≤ 5 % of the footprint and ≥ 1,000 px; ineligible rows stay in the report with their reason; `thin=False` rows whose threshold mask is already over the cap are recorded with their count and **not** shaped (dilation only adds pixels) | Unconstrained, the argmax of this metric is *emit the whole footprint*: measured union DTI **0.1229** at 5,164,312 px against **0.0207** for the best localised candidate. A baseline that ships a non-prediction is worse than no baseline | `baseline_report.json` → `policy_selection.eligibility`, `n_skipped_rows`; the first run was stopped rather than allowed to ship |
| **Select on one fold, measure on another** | `--fold` selects the policy, `--eval-fold` (default: the next fold) measures the winner; both are excluded from training; the report separates the two | `max()` over N noisy candidate scores is not an estimate, and quoting it as one is the classic selection-bias error. Measured: selection fold 0 union **0.160259** vs untouched fold 1 combined **0.0788** | `baseline_report.json` → `generalisation` (catalogue 0.0659 / proxy 0.0709 / combined 0.0788) with `reproduce_verified` |
| **`docs/verification.html` was published as a bare fragment** | `build_verification()` returned its body without calling `page()`: no doctype, no nav, no footer | A dead end on a site whose purpose is walking from a claim to its evidence — and nothing failed, because the only nav test asserted what `page()` does, never that each builder used it | Now wrapped; new `tests/test_site_pages.py` asserts every generated page is complete, carries the whole nav, links only to published pages, and that **regenerating the site changes nothing** |
| **`scripts/verify_links.py` could overwrite a measured record with a false one** | It now compares a run against the committed record and **refuses** (exit 3) when fewer than half the URLs that previously answered respond, with `--allow-degraded` as the explicit override; `generated_by` reports how many URLs actually answered | In this sandbox 77 of 84 URLs read as UNREACHABLE — a fact about egress, not about the links — and the file still claimed "on a GitHub-hosted runner (live HTTP)". The committed record was left intact | `tests/test_links_classifier.py`: 4 new tests, including the prefix bug (`EXPECTED_OK` is `("OK",)` while counts are keyed `"OK_200"`) that would have disabled the guard |
| **The baseline's own `reproduce` command did not reproduce** | It pointed `block_holdout_eval.py` at `prob_raw.tif`, but that script shapes by threshold + dilation and cannot thin, so it measured the un-thinned sibling (combined 0.1259) instead of the shipped field (0.0789) | A reproduction command that produces a different number is worse than none: it invites a reader to conclude the numbers are wrong. Corrected to score the shaped `submission.tif`, and **re-run to confirm** | `generalisation.reproduce` + `reproduce_verified`; a test pins that the command names `submission.tif` and disables the runner crosscheck |

| **NEW: make `block_holdout_eval.py` able to thin** | It can score threshold + dilation only, so no *thinned* field can be audited on the raw side — including the shipped ensemble's adopted policy (floor 0.1, width 0, thinned), whose audit has to go through the runner's own sweep file instead | Any future candidate that is thinned cannot be re-checked from its raw field by the repository's own audit tool; the workaround (score the shaped artifact) only works because a submission is binary | `scripts/block_holdout_eval.py` `candidate_emissions()`; the pinned sweep schema in `tests/test_block_holdout_eval.py` |
| **NEW: pin the site's own build in CI** | `tests/test_site_pages.py` runs the builder and asserts the committed pages match a fresh build (with the working-tree lines that report live raster presence stripped, and nothing else) | The site is a build artifact rendered from `data/evidence/*.json`; without this a page can silently go stale against the evidence it claims to render. CI found the one environment dependence: `docs/submission.html` reports whether `data/*.tif` is present, and that directory is gitignored | 6 tests, all passing; the first CI run of this file failed on exactly that difference and produced the fix |
| **NEW: make the placement table a committed record rather than a live reading** | `docs/submission.html` currently says "MATCHES THE PIN" or "ABSENT" depending on the checkout that built it, so the published page states a fact about a machine rather than about the project | A reader cannot tell whether the published page was built with the rasters present; the committed `data/evidence/data_placement.json` already holds the measured record (files, sha256, bytes, date) and could be rendered instead, with the live check as an extra column | `scripts/build_site.py` `build_submission()`; `data/evidence/data_placement.json` |

## Session 19 (2026-09-19) — the landed reports are read on every truth population, the submission path has its own page, and the third population is measured on both arms

| Area | What changed | Why it matters | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **All four block-holdout folds landed, and the gap is derived not asserted** | `scripts/read_landed_reports.py --gaps-only` recomposes the four committed `fold*_generalisation_gap.json` files; whichever job lands a fold refreshes the summary | Gaps **+0.0114 / −0.0070 / +0.0139 / +0.0093**, mean **+0.006904**, spread **0.020935**, positive in 3 of 4 — the sign is not stable, so the honest reading is *no clear memorisation, no clear transfer gain* and the full-grid DTI stays the selection statistic | `data/evidence/block_holdout/fold_gap_summary.json` |
| **A third truth population: the union** | `scripts/block_holdout_eval.py --combined-population` scores labels ∪ new-fault-like proxy pixels (122,652 px, disjointness verified at score time); off by default so every committed report keeps its pinned schema | Rules §3.6 scores Phase 2 on an *expanded* truth; the union is the closest local surrogate, and the two component populations of the pseudo-label signal disagree in sign, so only the union can settle it. `FP_w` is a sum over **prediction** pixels, so the union's DTI cannot be inferred from the components | `data/evidence/proxy/combined_truth_shipped.json`: shipped artifact **0.207431 CI95 [0.192924, 0.222879]** (catalogue 0.229799, proxy-only 0.099859); adopted policy 2nd of the 10 distinct emissions — width 1 px is **+0.0054 at P = 0.815**, below both pre-registered bars, so the policy **holds on a third population** |
| **Both arms of the fold-0 contrast on the union, via a download not a retrain** | `pseudo-label.yml` downloads the baseline arm's raw field from the run that produced its committed report (`BASELINE_RUN_ID=35413207736`, artifact `block-holdout-fold-0`) and re-scores it with `--combined-population` | The first fire's artifact did not carry `outputs/prob_raw.tif`, so that arm can never be re-scored; the baseline's field *is* still on its runner, which turns a second 300-minute training run into a download | `.github/workflows/pseudo-label.yml`; artifact id 10576951939, 24.8 MB, verified present 2026-09-19, expires 2026-10-03 |
| **A wrong run id fails instead of contrasting two fields** | The re-score step compares `sha256sum` of the downloaded raster against `inputs.pred_grid.sha256` in the committed report and `exit 1`s on mismatch; a missing file warns and the union contrast is reported `NOT_SCORED` | The failure mode it blocks is silent and total: two different probability fields paired block-by-block produce a contrast that looks like evidence | six new lint tests in `tests/test_workflow_yaml.py` pin the gate, the artifact contents and the parameter plumbing |
| **`--strict`: a derived number is committed only if an independent recomputation reproduces it** | `read_landed_reports.py --strict` exits 2 when its recomposition disagrees with the runner's own committed paired bootstrap; the workflow runs it before the commit step | The recomposition and the runner's inline bootstrap share no code path beyond the committed rows, so agreement is a real cross-check (it reproduces DTIs, CI95 and P = 0.999 exactly on the committed evidence) | `.github/workflows/pseudo-label.yml` step "Read both arms on every population"; `--check --strict --quiet` passes locally |
| **Sibling `*_combined.json` reports are read as a population, with provenance** | `scope_pair` returns the sibling path too; `_sibling()` validates it is the **same field** by input sha256; the contrast records per-population `sources` | Keeps the union numbers in their own file (schema-pinned originals untouched) while every derived number still says which file it came from | `data/evidence/pseudo_labels/fold0_two_population_contrast.json` |
| **Evidence pushes no longer race each other** | `scripts/push_evidence.sh` replaces `git commit; git pull --rebase; git push` in both evidence workflows | Three fold jobs and a pseudo-label fire from the same trigger push all rewrite the *same* derived `fold_gap_summary.json`; the old sequence failed the job when two interleaved, losing 300 minutes of evidence. On conflict the helper **regenerates the derived file from the merged tree** and re-stages exactly what was staged | `scripts/push_evidence.sh`; `test_evidence_pushes_survive_the_parallel_landing_of_derived_files` |
| **`docs/submission.html` — "Make a submission"** | New nav page answering only *what exactly do I do to submit*: artifact identity, format spec, the rules sentences that bind, the irregularities, and a pre-flight checklist | The submission is human-only, so the page is the handover artifact. Nothing on it is typed as a fact: sha256/bytes re-hashed at build time, placement table compared against whatever `data/` holds now, validator table parsed from its own committed log, rules quoted by id with their verification badge, catalog row count read from `docs/data_catalog.csv` (92 rows) | `docs/submission.html` (34 KB); `scripts/audit_docs.py` passes with 0 uncatalogued hosts; 13 page tests |
| **The tests found four real defects** | `relative_to(ROOT)` crashed on any path outside the repo (8 call sites → `_rel()`); directory/config defaults were bound at `def` time so monkeypatching the constant did nothing (`Path(arg or CONSTANT)`); the page rendered "rank 1 of ?" when the decision record carried no rank; a test token used `.title()` where the page says `single-band` | Each one was a latent bug in shipped code, not a test artifact — the first two would have broken any non-repo invocation of the reader | 368 passed, 1 skipped (from 318 at session start) |
| **GitHub Pages config irregularity flagged, not silently changed** | Verified via the API: `build_type: legacy`, `source: {branch: main, path: "/"}` — the *branch* build is what serves, while `pages.yml` uploads a `docs/`-rooted artifact and reports green | Today `/GEMSDOE/docs/executive_summary.html` resolves and `/GEMSDOE/executive_summary.html` 404s, so every README link is correct **for the legacy build only**. If Pages is ever switched to the Actions build, all of them break at once | `gh api repos/buffedlizard55-lab/GEMSDOE/pages`; both URLs fetched 2026-09-19 |

| **The union arm landed, and it is under-powered (not a green light)** | Run 35477119490: cross-run artifact download → sha256 gate → `--combined-population` re-score of BOTH arms → `--strict` derived reading → `scripts/push_evidence.sh` commit; every step `success` | Union, held-out blocks: baseline **0.197183** → pseudo **0.228463**, **+0.031280 at P = 0.916, CI95 [−0.010, +0.082]** — the interval spans zero on 8 scoreable blocks; trained-on blocks move the other way (**−0.0375**, P = 0.0025). Verdict `GAIN_ON_THE_COMBINED_SURROGATE`, `shippable_evidence: false` (a constant by construction — the reader makes no shipping decision). Against the rule that *does* exist (`docs/FIELD_SELECTION_RULE.md` R3 P ≥ 0.95, R1 +0.010) it clears the margin and misses P | `data/evidence/pseudo_labels/fold0_two_population_contrast.json`, `fold0_derived_reading.log`, `data/evidence/block_holdout/fold0_heldout_combined.json` |
| **NEW: pool the pseudo contrast over folds before trusting any of it** | Contrast the pseudo and baseline arms over all four folds' held-out blocks (≥12 scoreable blocks per scope) instead of one fold's 8 | Measured replicate noise between the two fires is ~0.036 on the proxy arm — the same order as the +0.0313 union effect — and the scorer marks any interval from <12 resampling units COARSE. One fold cannot separate this signal from its own training noise | The baseline arms' raw fields for folds 1–3 are on their runner artifacts (`block-holdout-fold-1/2/3` of run 35451858112, 14-day retention from 2026-09-19, i.e. **until ~2026-10-03**); the pseudo arm would have to be trained on those folds, so the cheap first step is a pooled *baseline* union score as the comparison point |

**Next session queue (priority order):**
1. **First leaderboard upload** — human-only; 3/week, one final selection before Dec 3, 2026 11:59 PM UTC. Until then every number here is a local surrogate and the public leaderboard (top **0.2854** over 50 ranked, snapshot 2026-09-21) is the only unbiased signal.
2. ~~**Read the re-fired fold-0 union contrast**~~ — **DONE 2026-09-20** (run 35477119490, every new step green): on the union, held-out blocks **0.197183 → 0.228463, +0.031280, P = 0.916, CI95 [−0.010, +0.082]** — suggestive, the interval spans zero on 8 scoreable blocks, and the trained-on scope moves the other way (−0.0375, P = 0.0025). Verdict `GAIN_ON_THE_COMBINED_SURROGATE`, `shippable_evidence: false`. **Do not re-fire fold 0 for a better number:** the two fires differ by ~0.036 on the proxy arm, so the effect is inside replicate noise. If this route is pursued, the next measurement is a contrast **pooled over the four committed folds** (≥12 scoreable blocks per scope) — see the two new rows above.
3. **1 m DEM derivatives** — highest-upside detection idea left, no external fault catalogue involved; code ready, needs unrestricted egress + ~50 GB.
4. **GPU full-config** — EfficientNet-B5, 10 MC splits, 60 epochs (`configs/config.yaml`).
5. **Union-population model selection** — early stopping / ensemble weights still maximise in-domain DTI; every fold field committed from now on carries the union population, so the signal exists to select on.
6. **Align Pages with `pages.yml`** (cosmetic, low priority) — either switch `build_type` to `workflow` *and* rewrite every `/docs/` link in the same commit, or drop the redundant deploy job. Do not do one without the other.

## Session 18 (2026-09-19) — the field axis is now ruled and gate-locked; the pseudo-label route is built, proven leakage-safe, and in flight

| Area | What changed | Why it matters | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **FIELD-selection rule pre-registered** | `docs/FIELD_SELECTION_RULE.md`: eligibility F1 (pinned re-blend provenance chain) + F2 (committed proxy sweep); adoption R1 (beats shipped + 0.010 margin, primary window), R2 (top of all 3 windows), R4 (beats current policy), R5 (≥ 3 candidates in window), R3 (paired 2,000-resample block bootstrap on both fields' raw rasters, P(new > shipped) ≥ 0.95); default KEEP mean12 | The field axis had been changed by hand twice (16-fold in, 11-fold out) with no rule — a policy decided after looking. A rule committed *before* the next re-blend is what keeps the next change honest | thresholds are rule constants (0.010 / 0.95 / 2000 / 3) in the checker, not in the data |
| **The rule has a machine checker and a gate** | `scripts/check_field_selection.py` runs over all committed sweeps and writes `data/evidence/field_selection.json`; `reblend.yml` runs it `--gate --runs <full RUN_ID set>` **before any artifact download** — the pinned re-blend passes without measurement, any other field needs a committed ADOPT with R3 measured | An unenforced rule is a suggestion; a gate that fails the job before a byte is downloaded is a rule. Position (before downloads) is itself pinned by test | verdict on committed evidence: **KEEP mean12** (mean12 F1/F2/R2/R4/R5 PASS; ens123 F1 UNVERIFIED + R1 FAIL 0.0850; single ensembles R1 FAIL) |
| **R3 cannot be waved through** | Until both fields' raw probability rasters are scored, every non-shipped field's R3 is `NOT_MEASURABLE_FROM_COMMITTED_BYTES` and the conjunction refuses | The one condition that cannot be satisfied from the committed bytes is the one that guards against cherry-picking a field that wins on a favourable support window | a synthetic field passing F1/F2/R1/R2/R4/R5 (measured from its own raster) is **still refused** by `tests/test_field_selection.py` while R3 is unmeasured, and ADOPTs end-to-end (gate rc 0) once R3 ≥ 0.95 |
| **Block-holdout fold 0 landed; folds 1–3 in flight** | `TRAIN_FOLDS=1,2,3` in `.github/triggers/block-holdout-params` (seed 46, fold 0 not re-trained) | Fold 0 measured **0.0806 [0.0586, 0.1021]** held-out vs **0.0920 [0.0747, 0.1100]** trained-on — gap **+0.0114** on 8/26 scoreable blocks. One fold is a point estimate; four give the spread the policy decision needs | `data/evidence/block_holdout/fold0_generalisation_gap.json`; three 300-min jobs dispatched by this session's trigger push |
| **SGMC pseudo-labels: built, leakage-proven, smoke-trained, in flight** | `src/dataset.py` `pseudo=`/`pseudo_weight=` path + `load_pseudo_mask()`; `configs/config_pseudo_labels.yaml` (baseline + exactly 3 keys); `.github/workflows/pseudo-label.yml` trains fold 0 (seed 46) and paired-bootstraps the held-out arm against the committed no-pseudo baseline | The scored faults are new; QFaults = the labels; the SGMC code-2 population (61,664 px) is the only remaining external-catalogue route (rules §3.2 allow it). Leakage safety is the design: partition + window selection on original labels alone (identical training set to baseline), held-out region zeroed from the pseudo mask (label mass *and* FP-weight map), held-out measurement against the labels | `tests/test_pseudo_labels.py` (7 tests incl. the leakage invariants); configs differ only in the pseudo keys (pinned); fixture smoke run: `+31 training-label px across 6 windows; partition and window selection unchanged`; paired reading lands in `data/evidence/pseudo_labels/fold0_paired_vs_baseline.json` |
| **A pseudo field cannot ship by shortcut** | The workflow header and EXEC §12 state it: a pseudo-labelled ensemble reaches the leaderboard only as a new `reblend.yml` RUN_ID through the field gate with measured R3 | The measurement and the shipping path are deliberately separated — a promising local number does not get to become a submission without passing the same rule as any other field | `pseudo-label.yml` header; EXEC §6/§12 |
| **Torch stack now installs in the sandbox (PyPI)** | torch 2.14.0+cu130 + smp 0.5.0 + timm 1.0.29 from PyPI (download.pytorch.org is egress-blocked; CUDA wheels run CPU-only here) | The torch-gated tests collect and pass locally for the first time instead of being a runner-only check; the fixture smoke run above was possible because of it | local suite **318 passed, 1 skipped** (skip: pre-existing evidence-dependent rules-quote) |
| **Three more static workflow lints** | gate sits before any data step in reblend.yml; pseudo scoring is `--score-fold`-restricted and pairs against the baseline's *held-out* (not complement) report; the committed pseudo fire targets a fold whose baseline is committed | The cross-catalogue class of bug (a workflow that quietly measures the wrong thing) is now linted at the new sites too, in 0.3 s with no runner | `tests/test_workflow_yaml.py` (9 tests); a deliberately mistyped Dropbox mirror URL was caught by the URL-subset lint during this session and fixed |

**Next session queue (priority order):**
1. **First leaderboard upload** — 3/week, 1 final before Dec 3, 2026 11:59 PM UTC (human-only); still the only source of unbiased signal.
2. **Read the four landed reports** — fold 1–3 generalisation gaps (`data/evidence/block_holdout/fold{1,2,3}_generalisation_gap.json`) + the pseudo paired contrast (`data/evidence/pseudo_labels/fold0_paired_vs_baseline.json`); update site/STATUS from them.
3. **1 m DEM derivatives** — the highest-upside detection idea left, no external fault catalogue involved; code ready, needs unrestricted egress + ~50 GB.
4. **GPU full-config** — EfficientNet-B5, 10 splits, 60 epochs (`configs/config.yaml`).
5. **Selection signal** — proxy-based early stopping / fold weighting.
6. **Finalist package** — Winning Model Documentation, code assets, GenAI disclosure, W-9/ACH.

## Session 17 (2026-09-19) — the dispatched measurements landed: one reproduced exactly, one refused itself with a finding

| Area | What changed | Why it matters | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Runner reproduction of the headline number** | `data/evidence/block_holdout/sandbox_vs_runner.json` compares ten quantities between the sandbox and an independent GitHub-hosted environment | Agreement across environments is what makes 0.0999 a property of the committed bytes rather than of one machine | **`agree: true` on all ten**; DTI **0.099859** and CI95 **[0.088338, 0.111886]** identical to the sandbox |
| **Cross-catalogue transfer measured — and refused** | The runner fetched QFaults layer 21 (14,481 features, `fetched == service_reported`), rasterised it on the competition grid, and the overlap with the training labels came out total | The prior on hidden-expert-set recall that EXEC §11 item 1 asked for **cannot** come from a second Quaternary catalogue: none is independent of these labels. That closes a strategy branch with data instead of argument | **60,938 of 60,939** in-footprint B px within R = 3 px of a label (**1** code-2 px); **60,986 of 60,988** label px within R of B; `data/evidence/xcat/qfaults_stats.json`, `transfer_report.json` |
| **A refusal is a report, not a crash** | `--min-b-only-px 100` / `--min-b-only-fraction 0.005` raise `PopulationDegenerate`; `main` catches it, writes the report **with the overlap that establishes it**, and exits 0 | Scoring a 1-pixel truth population would produce a number with no meaning; committing the refusal keeps the finding auditable instead of leaving a red ❌ that looks like a bug | `data/evidence/xcat/transfer_report.json` (`controls_pass: false`, `measurements: []`, `exit_code: 0`, input sha256s recorded) |
| **…and a broken raster still fails loudly** | `--min-b-all-px 1000`: an empty, misaligned or miscoded B exits non-zero and writes no report | The two cases must not be conflated — "B is the labels" is a finding, "B did not rasterise" is a defect | `tests/test_cross_catalogue.py::test_a_nearly_empty_b_raster_is_a_data_problem_that_fails_loudly` |
| **Workflow hardened** | `cross-catalogue.yml` read stats keys that do not exist (the schema nests under `proxy.`); it now reads `s["proxy"]`, separates **schema drift** from a **genuinely empty population**, and downgrades zero/near-zero code-2 to `::warning::` so the transfer job still commits the REFUSED report; the summary step renders both schemas | A failed job hides the result; the point of the run was the overlap, and the overlap is now the headline | run 35411164502 failed at "Record overlap"; all 13 embedded Python blocks in all 12 workflows parse, every YAML validates |
| **Ensemble 4 deferred on evidence** | Not fired | At matched emission support the 11-fold shipped mean scores **0.0999** vs **0.0850** for the 16-fold blend, and the ranking is stable in all three windows — more folds did not help | `data/evidence/emission_field_axis.json`, `ranking_stable_across_windows: true` |
| **A second defect, visible only because the first was fixed** | The params job read `[ -n "$(v BOOTSTRAPS)" ] && BOOT="$(v BOOT)"` — testing one key and assigning from another; `BOOT` is not in `cross-catalogue-params`, so the `\|\| '1000'` fallback was clobbered with `''` and argparse killed the transfer job in 28 s | It had been invisible for a session: the first run failed *earlier*, so the transfer job never started. Fixing one failure exposed the next — which is why the committed `transfer.log` mattered more than the runner's log UI | `data/evidence/xcat/transfer.log`; run 35412306524 |
| **Three static lints so the class cannot recur** | `tests/test_workflow_yaml.py` 3 → 6 tests: tested key == read key; a key read in an assignment is set in the params file or documented in the workflow header; an output interpolated straight into a `--flag` has a non-empty fallback (a push-triggered run has no `github.event.inputs`) | All three run in the sandbox in 0.4 s with no runner, and were mutation-checked by restoring the broken line | `tests/test_workflow_yaml.py`; local suite 285 → 288 passed |
| **The refusal, reproduced on a runner** | Third fire green end to end: re-fetch (14,481 features, integrity gate passed) → byte-identical raster (sha256 `3fb2ca73…`) → identical REFUSED report → committed evidence | A refusal only one machine ever produced would be an anecdote; three fetches and two environments agreeing on 60,939 / 60,938 / 1 makes it a measurement | run 35412827594; `data/evidence/xcat/transfer_report.json` (runner-generated 01:31:18Z) |
| **Both PRs merged to `main`** | [#23](https://github.com/buffedlizard55-lab/GEMSDOE/pull/23) → `1b97c61` (session 16 + runner evidence + the guard) and [#24](https://github.com/buffedlizard55-lab/GEMSDOE/pull/24) → `91c0473` (catalog row E39 link status corrected, site rebuilt) | The merge of #23 touched `.github/triggers/*`, so three workflows re-fired **on main**: a fourth QFaults fetch (all four source links OK_200 — the earlier 503s were transient), a fresh rules-quote check and a main-branch block-stratified measurement | On `main`: Tests ✓ Pages ✓ Cross-catalogue ✓ Verify sources ✓. #24's nine conflicts were all in **generated** `docs/*.html`, resolved by regenerating from the merged sources rather than hand-picking hunks |

**Next session queue (priority order):**
1. **First leaderboard upload** — 3/week, 1 final before Dec 3, 2026 11:59 PM UTC (human-only). This is now the *only* remaining source of unbiased signal: both machine-measurable questions the repository could ask have been answered.
2. **1 m DEM derivatives** (EXEC §11 item 3) — the highest-upside detection idea left, and the one that does not depend on any external fault catalogue. Code ready (`src/external_data.py`, `scripts/download_dem_tiles.py`); needs unrestricted egress + ~50 GB.
3. **Commit a FIELD-selection rule before any re-blend** — the policy axis is ruled (worst-case contrast across sweeps) but the field axis is not; `emission_field_axis.json` favours the shipped field, and a rule committed *before* the next re-blend is what keeps that honest.
4. **GPU full-config** — EfficientNet-B5, 10 splits, 60 epochs (`configs/config.yaml`); block-holdout folds 0–3 for a real generalisation gap.
5. **Pseudo-labels from the SGMC proxy** — now the *only* external-catalogue route, since QFaults turned out to be the labels. Must be measured under spatial holdout so a gain is not label leakage.
6. **Selection signal** — proxy-based early stopping / fold weighting.
7. **Finalist package** — Winning Model Documentation, code assets, GenAI disclosure, W-9/ACH.

## Session 16 (2026-09-18) — error bars, the field axis, and the cross-catalogue measurement

| Area | What changed | Why it matters | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Error bars on the emission decision** | Per-block DTI + paired block bootstrap over 51.2 km blocks (`scripts/block_holdout_eval.py`, `src/metrics.block_aggregate`, `bootstrap_from_blocks`) | Every emission number before this was one global point estimate; a 0.012 difference had no way to be judged against regional noise | Proxy DTI **0.0999, CI95 [0.0883, 0.1119]**; best different alternative (1 px) 0.0878, **P(beats reference) = 0.008**; `data/evidence/block_holdout/block_stratified.json` |
| **Degenerate axes reported, not hidden** | Duplicate emissions detected by sha1 of the emission; `verdict.n_distinct_emissions` / `floor_axis_degenerate` | A hard-band raster has two values, so 5 floors × 10 widths produced only **10 distinct** emissions — quoting "50 candidates" would overstate the sweep | same report, `prediction.hard_band = true` |
| **Reproduction gate** | `--crosscheck-sweep` compares the local score with the runner's committed sweep row and **exits 2** on mismatch | The sandbox and the runner are different environments; agreement is what makes the committed numbers a property of the bytes, not of one machine | dti 0.099859 both sides; components agree to ≤ 4.4e-4; `reproduction.status = "reproduced"` inside the report; `.github/workflows/block-holdout.yml` re-runs it on a runner |
| **The field axis, settled** | `scripts/compare_emission_fields.py` compares ensemble fields at **matched support** (±15/25/40 % windows, same rule per field) | A floor is a threshold on a field whose scale changes with the number of averaged folds (464,736 px at floor 0.1 on 6 folds vs 144,738 px on 16), so a fixed-floor comparison measures the floor, not the field | mean12 **0.0999** > ens123 0.0850 > ensemble2 0.0777 > ensemble1 0.0644, **stable in all three windows**; `data/evidence/emission_field_axis.json` |
| **Cross-catalogue transfer (EXEC §11 item 1)** | `scripts/fetch_qfaults.py` (QFaults layer 21, runtime metadata, renderer-derived class vocabulary, integrity gate, provenance sidecar) + `scripts/measure_cross_catalogue_transfer.py` (controls first, A-emission at widths, `union(model, A)` as a probability maximum, pre-registered verdict) + `.github/workflows/cross-catalogue.yml` | The proxy population **is** catalogue A, so it cannot say whether a policy travels between independently compiled catalogues — the one measurement that stands in for hidden-expert-set recall | 14,482 features verified live 2026-09-18; DOI 10.5066/P9BCVRCK, public domain; verdict is derived (`ADOPT`/`DO NOT ADOPT`/`REFUSED`/`NOT MEASURABLE`) |
| **Block-holdout training path** | `configs/config_block_holdout.yaml` (`training.holdout: spatial_blocks`) + `--score-fold K [--complement]`; the scoring partition is **cross-checked against the training partition** at runtime | A score computed on a partition the model was not trained against is not a holdout score; the generalisation gap becomes a measured pair with CIs | disagreement exits 2 (`block_holdout_eval.block_px` vs `training.block_px`); `restriction.note` states when a number is a reshaping measurement instead |
| **Two defects found in review** | Conflict counter required both signs (`blocks_labels_lose` vs `blocks_conflict_labels_lose_proxy_gains`); `build_proxy_catalogue.py` reads `classes.rule_id_to_class` as well as `query.rule_id_to_class` | The first overstated a population conflict 32 blocks where the true both-signs conflict is **9**; the second silently produced unnamed per-class rows for QFaults | `tests/test_block_holdout_eval.py::test_conflict_counters_require_both_signs`; `class_vocabulary_key` recorded in `qfaults_stats.json` |

**Next session queue (priority order):**
1. **First leaderboard upload** — 3/week, 1 final before Dec 3, 2026 11:59 PM UTC (human-only)
2. **Read the two dispatched measurements** — `data/evidence/xcat/transfer_report.json` (cross-catalogue verdict) and `data/evidence/block_holdout/runner_block_stratified.json` + `fold0_generalisation_gap.json` (runner reproduction + the memorisation gap). Neither changes the shipped artifact unless the pre-registered criteria say so.
3. **Commit a FIELD-selection rule before any re-blend** — the policy axis is ruled (worst-case contrast across sweeps) but the field axis is not; `emission_field_axis.json` currently favours the shipped field, and a rule committed *before* the next re-blend is what keeps that honest.
4. **GPU full-config** — EfficientNet-B5, 10 splits, 60 epochs (`configs/config.yaml`)
5. **Detection** — DEM derivatives, pseudo-labels from the external catalogue (only if the transfer verdict is `ADOPT`), block-holdout folds 1–3
6. **Selection signal** — proxy-based early stopping / fold weighting
7. **Finalist package** — Winning Model Documentation, code assets, GenAI disclosure, W-9/ACH

## Session 15 (2026-09-18) — executive summary polished for submission, 3-pass review, data re-verified

| Area | What changed | Why it matters | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Executive summary TL;DR** | 5-command box at top (`assemble → prepare → validate → upload`) | Entrants need copy-paste path without training | `EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md` §0 + `docs/executive_summary.html` TL;DR |
| **Pitfalls table** | 6 measured failures (stub, CRS, in-domain trap, sample-as-zero, missing data, GenAI) | Prevents silent failures that cost leaderboard submissions | `EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md` §8b + `tests/test_submission_writer.py` |
| **Data placement resolved** | One-line reproduction `git pull && assemble && prepare` | Former blocker verified gone (35168924460) | `data/evidence/data_placement.json` + 2026-09-18 re-verify |
| **Limitations & blockers** | Human-only vs infrastructure table | Top-leaderboard progress gated by account/GPU/eligibility | `EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md` §8d + `LIMITATIONS.md` |
| **3-pass review** | Implement → audit → re-check | No hallucinations, line-by-line verified | `audit_docs.py` PASS, 175 tests, self-test 8/8 |

## Session 13 (2026-09-17) — the emission policy is measured, reproduced, and SHIPPED

| Improvement | Why it matters | Status / evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Ship a policy that was MEASURED, not calibrated | The in-domain calibration maximises DTI against the faults the model trained on; the prize scores faults the labels lack, and the two populations disagree on sign (0.1903 → 0.0908 in-domain vs +0.11 on the new-fault-like population) | ✅ `blend_submission.py --shaping-t0/--shaping-dilate/--shaping-source` (joint policy or parse error), `reblend.yml` SHAPING_T0/DILATE/SOURCE, `tests/test_adopted_policy.py` verifies the written pixels are the adopted policy applied to the saved ensemble mean |
| Measure on the field that ships | A floor is a threshold on the MEAN field, not on any single ensemble's field; both sweeps so far measured one ensemble each | ✅ `proxy-eval.yml` takes `RUN_ID=a,b,c` and blends every downloaded fold into ONE mean before sweeping; 5 tests pin the quiet failures (delimiter-free `cut -f2`, an empty second download passing as a successful sweep) |
| Candidate-wise decision rule | The record asserted a verdict about the widest band while its own best measured candidate was a floor change | ✅ conditions 1–3 are evaluated against the best measured candidate; condition 3 takes a LIST of independently trained sweeps and compares each contrast against that sweep's own reference policy |
| Cross-ensemble robustness ranking | The candidate is the argmax of one field until proven otherwise — and two of the three fields do have a different argmax (floor 0.05, rejected by ensemble 1 at −0.0266) | ✅ every hard candidate present in every sweep is ranked by its WORST contrast; across the three committed sweeps the shipped candidate ranks 1 of 132 (worst +0.0456 on ensemble 2, runner-up +0.0414), and a `warning` is recorded if it ever is not first |
| Condition 3 MEASURED and passing | The pre-registered gate between a measurement and a shipped change | ✅ three fields: ensemble 1 +0.0954, ensemble 2 (run 35249562910, seed 43) **+0.0456**, and the SHIPPING field (mean of 1+2, run 35275312337) **+0.0695** (0.0999 vs 0.0304); `data/evidence/emission_decision.json` conclusion = **SHIP**, all three conditions recorded as passing |
| The shipped policy | floor 0.1, thin, width 0 px — a floor change, not a wider band; widening HURTS at that floor on both fields | ✅ `SHAPING_T0=0.1` / `SHAPING_DILATE=0` in `.github/triggers/reblend-params`, blended over ensembles 1+2 (11 live folds, `MIN_FOLDS=11`) → `data/evidence/runs/ens12-adopted-floor0.1-w0/submission.tif`, sha256 `7f00890a62878d61…` (conformed to the template mask 2026-09-25; pre-fix bytes were `a3dcd6d5…`), written support **172,974 px** = the mean12 sweep's measured emission for that exact policy, TIFF tags `shaping_t0=0.1 / shaping_thin=True / shaping_dilate=0 / shaping_source=adopted_measured_policy`, format validation passed |

### Session 13 queue, in order

1. ~~Confirm the policy on the shipping field~~ **DONE** (run 35275312337, `SWEEP_LABEL=mean12`): on
   the exact mean field the adopted policy is applied to, floor 0.1 beats the reference policy by
   **+0.0695** (0.0999 vs 0.0304) and the record now carries all three sweeps in condition 3, with the
   shipped candidate still rank 1 of 132 by worst-case contrast (`eval_sweep-mean12.json`, committed
   by the same run at `8713331`).
2. ~~Ensemble 3 sweep confirmation~~ **DONE** (run 35285326679, `SWEEP_LABEL=ens123`, 16 live folds
   over ensembles 1+2+3). The sweep on the 16-fold mean over seeds 42, 43, 44 (`eval_sweep-ens123.json`)
   confirmed that floor 0.1 / thin / width 0 px beats its reference policy by **+0.0581 contrast**
   (0.0850 vs 0.0269), providing a fourth field-level reproduction of the adopted policy's superiority.
3. ~~Two paths can still ship the OLD policy~~ **FIXED.** `python -m src.inference` (the
   path `train-and-submit.yml` drives) used to shape with `manifest["shaping"]`, the floor calibrated
   against the faults the model trained on — worth 0.0247 on the new-fault-like population against the
   adopted 0.1365 — and said nothing about which it had used. `src/inference.py` now resolves the
   policy through `effective_shaping()`: an explicit config floor wins but is tagged
   `explicit_config_override` and reported as having overridden a measurement; otherwise the SHIP
   record is adopted; the in-domain calibration is reached only when no measurement exists, and is
   labelled as such. Every written raster now carries `shaping_t0/thin/dilate/source/evidence` tags
   (matching `blend_submission.py`) and the run summary records the adopted policy AND the in-domain
   counterfactual. `tests/test_inference_adopted_shaping.py` pins all of it, including that a record
   which does not say SHIP is never adopted.
4. **Executive Summary Delivered:** Created [`docs/executive_summary.html`](https://buffedlizard55-lab.github.io/GEMSDOE/docs/executive_summary.html)
   and [`EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md`](EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md) containing the complete executive guide for contest
   submission, rules compliance (§1.3, §1.4, App A), GenAI disclosure (§3.2), and GeoTIFF validation.
5. **Detection is the binding constraint, now quantified.** 74 % of the new-fault-like truth lies
   more than 12 px from any emitted pixel (`miss_distance-ensemble1.json`); the oracle ceiling is
   1.0000 at width 0 and 0.1618 at 16 px, and the leaderboard's top score (0.2854, 2026-09-21
   snapshot) is 11.5× the constant-ones baseline measured here. The two experiments below are the
   remaining upside.
6. **Cross-catalogue transfer measurement.** Emitting an external fault catalogue (allowed by the
   rules) would raise recall on unmapped faults directly, but the proxy population CANNOT measure it:
   the proxy *is* the catalogue (a catalogue copy scores 0.0 there by the acceptance test). The
   honest design is to emit catalogue A and score against an independent catalogue B (e.g. the USGS
   Quaternary fault and fold database), reporting the transfer as a prior on what A captures of the
   hidden expert set. Nothing in the repository measures that yet; it is the highest-upside
   unmeasured idea left.
7. **Spatial block-holdout** — resolves the in-domain/proxy sign conflict by construction instead of
   choosing between populations.
8. **Training selection still maximises in-domain DTI** (early stopping, fold weights). The emission
   policy no longer does; the model still does. A selection signal on a new-fault-like population is
   the structural fix.
9. **Human-only (unchanged):** DrivenData account + enrolment, first upload (3/week), eligibility
   check (§1.3), Pages source setting, generative-AI + code assets at the deadline.


**Review update 2026-09-17:** official competition pages were fetched again; see
[`REVIEW_2026-09-17.md`](REVIEW_2026-09-17.md) for the line-by-line source table and limitations.

## Session 12 (2026-09-17) — measured + hardened

| Improvement | Why it matters | Status / evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Oracle ceiling per band width | Bounds every policy of that width and is independent of the hidden truth size | ✅ 16 px caps at **0.1618** while the model captures 44.1 % of it; `--oracle`, `data/evidence/proxy/oracle_ceiling-proxy.json`, exact-line test in `tests/test_miss_distance.py` |
| Value axis measured at matched support | "Hard band vs distance ramp" was plausible but unmeasured; now it is measured on the shipped submission's own support | ✅ hard wins at 3/6/12/16 px (3 px: 0.0509 vs 0.0316; 16 px: 0.0713 vs 0.0595); `data/evidence/proxy/eval_value_axis.json` |
| `--min-dilate` can no longer be a silent no-op | The raw unshaped row seeded the search and the un-thinned branch had width 0, so a run asked for a 16 px band could ship the skeleton and report success | ✅ seed loses by construction, un-thinned branch excluded, `excluded_from_search` in the report, `main()` asserts the width; `tests/test_ensemble.py` now requires `dilate == 3` for `--min-dilate 3` |
| Third independent ensemble fired | The final submission should be one nanmean over every live fold set | ✅ folds 12–17, seed 44, run 35263581931; the width is applied later at blend time (`MIN_DILATE`), so folds stay reusable |

### Session 12 queue, in order

1. **Condition 3** of the pre-registered decision: sweep ensemble 2 (run 35249562910) and ensemble 3
   (35263581931) on the proxy population. The extended ensemble-1 sweep (152 candidates) puts the
   best hard candidate at **floor 0.1, width 0 px (proxy DTI 0.1365 vs the shipped policy's 0.0410
   on the same field)**, with widening *hurting* at that floor — so the candidate to reproduce is a
   floor change, not a band, and the decision record now ranks the best candidate of every swept
   floor and applies the same second-ensemble reproduction rule to it. Ship through `reblend.yml`
   (`RUN_ID=a,b[,c]`) with the calibrated floor/width only after the reproduction passes; until then
   the shipped default is unchanged.
2. **Detection is the thing to fix, and it is now quantified.** The oracle table says a perfect
   localizer that emits the truth scores 1.0 while every band is capped below it, and the model
   captures 44 % of the 16 px cap. More independent folds, then the two experiments below.
3. **Cross-catalogue transfer measurement.** Emitting an external fault catalogue (allowed by the
   rules) would raise recall on unmapped faults directly, but the proxy population CANNOT measure it:
   the proxy *is* the catalogue (a catalogue copy scores 0.0 there by the acceptance test). The
   honest design is to emit catalogue A and score against an independent catalogue B (e.g. the USGS
   Quaternary fault and fold database), reporting the transfer as a prior on what A captures of the
   hidden expert set. Nothing in the repository measures that yet; it is the highest-upside
   unmeasured idea left.
4. **Spatial block-holdout** — resolves the in-domain/proxy sign conflict by construction instead of
   choosing between populations.
5. **Reset the training trigger** before the next ensemble fire: `.github/triggers/ensemble-params`
   currently holds `FOLD_OFFSET=12` / `ENSEMBLE_SEED=44` for run 35263581931; the next fire needs a
   new offset (18) and seed (45).
6. **Human-only (unchanged):** DrivenData account + enrolment, first upload (3/week), eligibility
   check (§1.3), Pages source setting, generative-AI + code assets at the deadline.

## Session 11 (2026-09-17) — implemented + measured

| Improvement | Why it matters | Status / evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Ramp emission as a second, separately measured axis | The width sweep answered "what support"; nothing had measured "what VALUES on that support" | ✅ `src/submission_optim.soft_band` (support identical to the hard band by construction), `scripts/eval_proxy_catalogue.py --soft-band`, `tests/test_shaping_band.py` (8 tests) |
| Measured answer: hard band beats the ramp at equal support | Stops a plausible-sounding idea from being shipped on plausibility | ✅ every width, same support: 3 px 0.0509 vs 0.0316, 16 px 0.0713 vs 0.0595 (γ=1); `data/evidence/proxy/eval_value_axis.json` |
| Auditable floor grid (`field_mass_profile`) | Session 10 found the floor axis was binary but only by reconstruction; the evidence file never said so | ✅ support above floor recorded before thinning on every candidate floor; `distinct_supports: 1` on the shipped field |
| Explicit floor candidates (`--shaping-values`) | The log-spaced grid jumped 4.3e-2 → 0.9 on this field | ✅ the sweep can now be given an interpretable grid, and the workflow passes it through (`SHAPING_VALUES`) |
| Multi-ensemble blend (`RUN_ID=a,b,c`) | The final submission should be one nanmean over every live fold set, not one ensemble | ✅ `reblend.yml` + `fold_provenance.txt` + `tests/test_reblend_workflow.py` |
| MIN_DILATE reaches the ensemble blend job | A measured width that no workflow reads cannot ship | ✅ `train-ensemble.yml` reads it from the committed trigger file; 2 tests execute the step |
| `cut -f2` single-run defect | Without a delimiter `cut` returns the WHOLE line: one run id would have been blended twice | ✅ fixed + pinned by executing the workflow's own shell |

### Session 11 rationale, kept for the record

The queue that session 11 wrote for itself was: (1) raise recall on faults absent from `labels.tif`
(the oracle table below puts a number on how much room there is), (2) reproduce the width gain on a
second ensemble, (3) measure the transfer of an external fault catalogue with a second independent
catalogue, (4) build the spatial block-holdout, (5) the human-only steps. Session 12 carries all
five forward in its own queue above.

## Session 10 (2026-09-17) — implemented + measured

| Improvement | Why it matters | Status / evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Localization-vs-detection decomposition | The width sweeps said *that* widening helps; they could not say whether the remaining error is reachable by width at all | ✅ `scripts/measure_miss_distance.py`, `data/evidence/proxy/miss_distance-ensemble1.json`, `tests/test_miss_distance.py` |
| Exact metric vs band width, same emitted set | Isolates the marginal value of width from any re-ranking of the probability field | ✅ width 0 → 16 px: 0.0247 → **0.0713** (+0.0466); 74.0 % of the truth is unreachable by width |
| Width projected onto the unknown scored-truth size | The decision stops resting on which anchor population one prefers | ✅ `width_vs_scored_truth_size` in `emission_decision.json`; crossover \|G\| = 20,000 px (2,000 km) |
| `--min-dilate` on the blend | Ship a measured band without overruling the in-domain calibration | ✅ `scripts/blend_submission.py`, `tests/test_ensemble.py` |
| Dilate grid reaches the measured optimum | The first sweep stopped at 12 px; the measured optimum is 16 | ✅ `.github/workflows/proxy-eval.yml` default `0,1,2,3,4,6,8,10,12,16,20` |
| One failed fold must not discard five | Run 35249562910 lost fold 4 in training; the binary rule discarded ~15 CPU-hours of successful folds | ✅ `MIN_FOLDS` gate + `foldlogs-<fold>` diagnostics artifact + `reblend.yml` parameterised recovery; 4 workflow tests execute the gate's real shell |

| Proxy sweep scored the shipped policy | Its log-spaced floor grid jumped 4.3e-2 → 0.9, so the floor the blend actually shipped (0.469674) was never a row and the acceptance rule compared against the t0=0 skeleton (0.0144) instead of the shipped policy (0.0247) | ✅ `--reference-t0` / `--reference-report` in `scripts/eval_proxy_catalogue.py`, `SHAPING_GRID` default 4 → 11, `--reference-report blend_report.json` in `proxy-eval.yml`; 2 tests execute both paths, and reinserting the old behaviour fails exactly them |

### Session 10 queue, in order

1. **Detection is now the binding constraint — sweep the threshold, not just the width.** 74.0 % of
   the new-fault-like truth lies more than 12 px (1.2 km) from any emitted pixel, so the next
   experiment is a joint (probability threshold × band width) sweep on the ensemble probability
   field: a lower threshold buys recall far more cheaply than a wider band, and the metric's β = 0.8
   already prices false positives. *Acceptance:* proxy DTI at the joint optimum > 0.0713 without
   the held-out-crop DTI falling below the same-policy baseline (re-measure both under one shaping
   grid; the current local_score 0.13871 is a different policy).
2. **Condition 3 of the pre-registered emission decision** — read
   `data/evidence/proxy/eval_sweep-ensemble2.json` when run 35249562910 lands (`.github/triggers/proxy-eval-params`,
   `RUN_ID=35249562910`, `SWEEP_LABEL=ensemble2`); switch the shipped band to 16 px only if the
   floor-controlled contrast beats +0.01 at every common floor.
3. **Pseudo-labels from the proxy trace (self-training)** — the SGMC trace is external data that may
   legally inform the model, but only the *emission* may consume it, never the width, and the score
   must be re-measured on a held-out part of the trace so the gain cannot be the label leaking.
4. **Spatial block-holdout** — resolves the in-domain/proxy sign conflict by construction instead of
   choosing between the two populations.
5. **Human-only (unchanged):** DrivenData account + enrolment, first upload (3/week), eligibility
   check (§1.3), Pages source setting, generative-AI + code assets at the deadline.

## Session 8 implementation queue closed

| Improvement | Why it matters | Status / evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Route direct inference through the fail-loud submission writer | The blend path was protected, but a user running `src.inference` could still recreate the invalid tiled TIFF | ✅ `src/inference.py`, `tests/test_ensemble.py`, `src/submission_io.py` |
| Make Python pipeline failures observable | A successful `grep || true` subshell can turn a crashed trainer into a green workflow | ✅ `.github/workflows/train-and-submit.yml` and `train-ensemble.yml` now use `set -euo pipefail` without masking filters; failed folds block blending |
| Wire optional 3DEP DEM derivatives consistently | A config flag previously advertised DEM features without adding them, risking train/inference channel mismatch | ✅ `src/external_data.py` + `src/dataset.py`; reprojected local mosaic, five derivatives, explicit path; default disabled until data is supplied |
| Keep lightweight checks lightweight | A test importing a split helper should not require SMP model construction | ✅ `src/models.py` lazy import; model creation still reports a clear dependency error |
| Make optional rules text evidence explicit | A report without `extracted_text` is valid for link/source verification | ✅ `tests/test_rules_quotes.py` skips only that unavailable optional artifact |

**Goal:** Constantly reviewed and improved upon via autonomous deep research, scientific literature, organized knowledge, critical thinking.

**Sources:** All verified, no hallucinations, links for manual review in `docs/literature.md` and `docs/references.md`.

## -1. Implemented + measured since the last review (2026-09-12, fresh sandbox)

| Item | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Test-region leakage in `make_patches` (HIGH) | ✅ **fixed** — test windows are zeroed in the global raster before training windows are cut; per-window assertion added | `tests/test_metric.py::test_patches_have_no_label_leakage`, passes |
| Augmentation wired into training | ✅ **fixed** — label-consistent numpy crop/flips/rot90/noise in `FaultDataset`, incl. the FP-weight map | `test_augmentation_is_label_consistent` |
| Metric memory blow-up (dense (H,W,7,7) array → OOM at GeoDAWN scale) | ✅ **fixed** — `score_arrays_blocked`, blocked with an R halo, asserted identical to the dense path | `test_blocked_equals_dense` |
| Loss now equals the scored metric | ✅ **new** — `DistanceWeightedTverskyLoss` (29-offset kernel, α/β from the page); asserted == 1 − DTI of the scorer | `test_dw_loss_is_the_metric` |
| Submission shaping derived from the metric's algebra, tuned on held-out windows | ✅ **new** — `src/submission_optim.py`; floor + distance-R dominating thinning, pooled search → `manifest.json` | held-out DTI 0.0437 → **0.1210** (docs/results.html §3) |
| Model selection on the quantity we are scored on | ✅ **new** — selection uses *shaped* held-out DTI, not Tversky loss | per-epoch log line in the run transcript |
| Pretrained encoders | ⏳ unchanged — release-asset host blocked; `pretrained: true` works on an unrestricted machine | LIMITATIONS §1c |
| Full-region DEM features (slope/curv/TPI/TRI/hillshade from 1 m tiles) | ⏳ code ready (`src/external_data.py`), tiles un-downloadable here (S3 blocked) | `scripts/download_dem_tiles.py` |
| Semi-supervised / self-training on the region's unlabeled half | 🆕 **proposed next** — the metric's FP cost is area-proportional, so self-training with high-confidence pseudo-labels is the cheapest way to sharpen the background; run after the first GPU pass | analysis in `src/submission_optim.py` docstring |
| Orientation-aware post-processing (faults in Walker Lane have preferred strikes) | 🆕 proposed: penalise sub-vertical/sub-horizontal thin lines by strike histogram; validate on held-out windows before trusting it | none yet — deliberately not implemented blind |

## -2. Session 2026-09-15 — implemented + measured

| Item | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Scoring universe verified from sources | ✅ **verified** — both rounds score the NEW-fault set only (problem page + rules PDF §1.1 fetched this session); known-fault copy = trap, local DTI = plumbing monitor | `docs/METRIC_STRATEGY.md` §4 + `STATUS.md` session-3 |
| Reference-solution cross-check | ✅ **verified** — 19/19 band descriptions of the acquired `gems-geodawn-numerical-features.tif` equal the reference notebook's executed output verbatim; grid/CRS/nodata match; notebook confirms `numeric_features.tif` name, min-max norm, cuda→mps→cpu device order | `STATUS.md`, comparison run in-session (fixture manifest carries the same tags with the `band_name - ` prefix) |
| Parallel MC-ensemble on CPU runners | ✅ **implemented** — `train-ensemble.yml`: 6 fold jobs (one fold each, `training.mc_id`), blend job (`scripts/blend_submission.py`): nanmean + ONE pooled-shaping pass + validate + score + commit report and shaped `submission.tif` back to the branch | configs + workflow + `tests/test_ensemble.py` (23/23 suite green) |
| Fold-weighted blending | ✅ **measured, nuance captured** — 2 folds: equal weights let a weak fold (0.049 held-out) bury a strong one (0.150), dti-softmax lifted the blend 0.0143 → 0.0984; 6 folds: dti-softmax HURT (0.1033 → 0.0656, crop-noise). **Equal is the workflow default**; `--weights dti` documented for catastrophic-fold exclusion | `data/evidence/runs/local-mini-ensemble/` (4 reports + README) |
| Per-epoch shaping table cost at patch 256 | ✅ **fixed** — the search scored the bbox of 12 *scattered* held-out windows ≈ the whole raster (≈7 min/epoch of EDTs, CPU); now: `selection_mode: raw` per epoch + `_compact_window_subset` picks the smallest fault-bearing contiguous run for the crop the table IS run on | `src/train.py`, unit test in `tests/test_ensemble.py` |
| `early_stopping_patience` implemented | ✅ **fixed** — was config-only, never read; now honoured on shaped/raw DTI, plus `training.max_minutes` wall-clock guard so a job CANNOT time out without saving its best checkpoint | `src/train.py` |
| `pretrained: true` robustness | ✅ **fixed** — weight-download failure now warns and trains from scratch instead of crashing the fold | `src/models.py` |
| Docs pseudo-URL (an `https:` + ellipsis stub) | ✅ fixed — reworded 2026-09-16 (session 6), because the row describing the fix still contained the stub and the audit kept flagging it; the audit now lists zero uncatalogued hosts | `scripts/audit_docs.py` PASS |

**Next (queued, in order):**
1. Run the 6-fold ensemble workflow once GitHub auth is restored (push = trigger). Read its report from `data/evidence/runs/<id>/`, then iterate: fold count, epochs within budget, `shaping_grid` refinement (0.2–0.6 at 0.05 steps around the selected floor).
2. ~~A/B `frangi_filter` at the blend step~~ **measured 2026-09-15: NEGATIVE on the fixture** (frangi ON: held-out 0.0991, calibration retreats to blanket; OFF: 0.1286, thin). Kept off; revisit only as a floor-gated residual on stronger models. `data/evidence/runs/local-mini-ensemble/AB_FRANGI.md`.
3. Spatial block-holdout validation (train on two thirds by x, score the untouched third) as a harder proxy for the new-fault discovery regime than random MC windows; keep MC as the primary so numbers stay comparable to the reference.
4. Self-training with high-confidence pseudo-labels after the first real ensemble (background sharpening; FP mass is area-proportional).
5. 1 m DEM derivatives (code ready) on the GPU box; pretrain-on-external-GeoDAWN-regions idea needs a band-mapping plan first — flagged, not started.
6. Human-only steps: DrivenData account + submit (3/week limit), report the `example_submission.tif` == labels anomaly on the forum, flip Pages source to "GitHub Actions".

## 0. Priority code fixes queued from E2E verification (2026-09-12)

1. **Test-region leakage in `make_patches`** (src/dataset.py): training windows partially overlapping held-out test patches are kept; reference solution zeroes test regions GLOBALLY before patching. Fix: apply a global boolean test mask before sliding-window extraction. Priority HIGH (affects trust in local DTI).
2. **Wire augmentation into training** (src/dataset.py FaultDataset / train loop): flips + 90° rotations minimum (matches TTA); RandomResizedCrop optional. Docs currently overstate this — flagged in docs/index.html.
3. **Pretrained encoders**: unreachable from sandbox (release-asset host blocked). On unrestricted machines, `pretrained: true` in configs/config.yaml works; verify EfficientNet-B5/MIT-B2 weight integrity after download.
4. **Seismicity band**: the reconstructed eq-density band (500 m Albers → 100 m) is coarser than the official earthquake-density band; treat as analog only.

### 5. Ensemble of Architectures (TransVNet 2025)
**Paper:** https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/earth-science/articles/10.3389/feart.2025.1635344/full — TransVNet significantly enhances accuracy and continuity vs U-Net (noise, poor continuity, low res, blurred boundaries) and TransUNet (noise artifacts, discontinuous). Threshold 0.7 for fault probability volume.
**Implemented:** `src/models.py:get_model()` supports unet, unetplusplus, deeplabv3plus, segformer, fpn with efficientnet-b5, mit_b2 pretrained. `EnsembleModel` averages logits. Cycle architectures per MC split for diversity.

### 6. Attention Mechanisms (Geo-SegNet 2025, Magnetic Anomalies 2022)
**Papers:** https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949673X25000026 (Geo-SegNet — contrastive-learning encoder (modified ResNet-101) inside U-Net improves geomaterial segmentation vs standard U-Net. NOTE verified scope: micro-CT pore segmentation of sandstone cores — method inspiration only, not fault-specific) and https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0098300422001765 (Florsch et al 2022: YOLO+DenseNet + Grad-CAM + t-SNE for magnetic anomaly characterization; U-Net-like with attention refines via channel and spatial attention)
**Implemented:** SegFormer uses self-attention, DeepLabV3+ uses atrous spatial pyramid pooling for multi-scale context, attention refines feature maps.

### 7. Contrastive Learning (Geo-SegNet)
**Paper:** https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949673X25000026 — Contrastive learning improves ability to differentiate between features.
**Implemented:** Suggestion for future work — self-supervised pretraining on DEM patches via masked autoencoder or contrastive, noted in LIMITATIONS.md and literature.md.

### 8. Two-Stage Coarse-to-Fine (Geothermal RS+ML+DL 2025)
**Paper:** https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0375650525000902 — RF coarse + MUnet fine, F1 90.91% GDA 2.82%, RF-MUnet F1 92.47% GDA 1.94%, factors LST, mag anomaly, gravity anomaly, distance to faults/rivers, nighttime light, land use, landform, lithology, geomorphic units for topo effects, multichannel U-Net optimized.
**Implemented:** Hard-negative mining in `make_patches()` keeps 30% negatives, similar to coarse-to-fine. First stage simple threshold on slope/gravity/mag candidate mask, second stage U-Net ensemble fine.

### 9. CET Grid Analysis + Fault Fracture Density (Integrated Structural Analysis 2025)
**Paper:** https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11834046/ — Subsurface lineaments via CET grid analysis in Oasis Montaj, enhance textures + edge detection, FFD maps via lineament length per grid cell in ArcGIS, higher fidelity for high-permeability zones vs surface only, 5 high-density zones correlated to hot springs.
**Implemented:** FFD concept via Frangi + closing + lineament density in postprocess, could be extended with Oasis Montaj.

### 10. Euler Deconvolution + DBSCAN Clustering (Chukwu et al 2024, Exploration Geophysics)
**Paper:** https://doi.org/10.1080/08123985.2023.2299475 — Chukwu, Betts, Moore, Munukutla, Armit, McLean & Grose (2024), Exploration Geophysics 55(3), 223–245 (online 03 May 2024; accepted 21 Dec 2023) — Euler deconvolution estimates location/depth of mag anomalies, DBSCAN identifies clusters irregular shapes/densities to determine fault location/dip over large distances/depths, track faults near-surface to deep roots.
**Implemented:** Future work suggestion in `src/external_data.py` — apply Euler deconvolution to GeoDAWN magnetic data to get depth solutions, cluster with DBSCAN, use as additional feature channel.

**Paper:** https://geoconvention.com/wp-content/uploads/abstracts/2019/GC2019_313_Deep_learning_approach_to_automatic_detection_of_faults_and_fractures_CNN.pdf — Magnetic data huge volume, traditional interpretation subjective slow tedious, edge detectors identify abrupt discontinuities via sharp changes in color/intensity gradients, line detectors highlight coherent alignments, high effectiveness for faults, fractures, lithological boundaries.
**Implemented:** Post-processing uses Sobel-like gradients via slope of TMI and gravity, plus Frangi for line enhancement.

### 13. Physics-Informed Loss (Joint Gravity and Magnetic Inversion 2024)
**Paper:** https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/16/7/1115 — CNN-based inversion relies more on data-driven training, does not heavily depend on prior assumptions unlike traditional, direct mapping from field data to subsurface property.
**Implemented:** Suggestion — add auxiliary loss encouraging predicted faults to align with high shear strain rate and high conductivity, or fault orientation align with strain tensor eigenvectors from GPS https://gsrm2.unavco.org/model/model.html

### 14. Multi-channel U-Net Optimized for Geothermal (Geothermal RS+ML+DL 2025)

**Implemented:** Ensemble includes multi-channel input (15 + 5 DEM derivatives = 20 channels) and progressive decoding via UNet++ dense skip connections and DeepLabV3+ atrous.

### 15. Human-in-the-Loop Semi-Supervised Iterative (Springer 2026)
**Paper:** https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12145-026-02224-5 — GWSU-Net with pixel-level weighting, comprehensive confidence evaluation, human-in-the-loop semi-supervised iterative strategy to automatically identify and vectorize faults and geological boundaries from 19 archived geological maps, 32k patches 128x128.
**Implemented:** Active learning concept — model predictions with high confidence but not in labels flagged for expert review — exactly what Final Round does (expert panel uses submissions to update labels). Our low threshold + high recall aims to maximize such discoveries for Final Round.

## Critical Thinking — Challenges Addressed

**From Hermant et al 2025 https://pangea.stanford.edu/ERE/db/GeoConf/papers/SGW/2025/Hermant.pdf discussion:**
- High imbalance → Tversky + Focal + BCE, hard-negative mining, weighted metrics
- Complex signature similar to other geomorph objects → multi-source fusion, Frangi + closing but also filter via mag/gravity/conductivity
- Label uncertainty, incomplete → MC CV, high recall loss, low threshold, expert review loop (Final Round rewards discoveries)
- Overfitting → pretrained encoders ImageNet, augmentation, ensemble, TTA
- Spatial bias → homogenize via model, not just memorize known faults
- Resolution 100m vs 1m DEM → multi-scale approach, DEM derivatives

**From problem page https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/306/competition-doe-gems/page/967/:**
- Ground truth incomplete, may contain inaccurate data → distance-weighted Tversky R=300m triangular kernel mitigates rasterization lossy and misalignment
- New faults manually identified by experts comprise test → must generalize to hidden faults, not just USGS
- Expert panel uses submissions to update labels → Final Round rewards true discoveries, our low threshold + high recall maximizes such

**Physics-informed:**
- Faults cause elevation changes, SL increases due to sudden surface height changes
- Faults show as sharp changes/high gradients in magnetic images → edge/line detectors
- Gravity/magnetic inversion via CNN direct mapping without heavy priors

## 2026-09-16 — measured next experiments (each with an acceptance criterion)

1. **Aggregation calibration, leave-one-fold-out — implemented 2026-09-16, runner A/B running.**
   `scripts/blend_submission.py --calibrate loo` re-fits the floor (and the fold-weight rule) on the
   folds that are *not* being scored, scores the held-out one, and prints the oracle ceiling next to
   it: the gap between the pooled and the LOO mean **is** the selection optimism, as a number instead
   of an assumption. The same run sweeps the emission width (`--dilate-grid 0,1,2,3,4,6`).
   *Acceptance:* keep a wider band only if the **LOO** mean improves by > 0.01 over the `dilate=0`
   skeleton on held-out folds, and reproduce it on a second ensemble before trusting it. Existing
   counter-evidence stands (2-fold toy: DTI weights helped 0.014→0.098; 6-fold mini ensemble: they hurt
   0.103→0.066) — which is exactly why the criterion is the LOO number and not the pooled one.
   Evidence lands in `data/evidence/runs/35042805806-experiment/` (workflow `reblend.yml`) —
   corrected 2026-09-16: this line pointed at a `...-dilate-ab/` directory that no run ever wrote;
   the committed evidence is in `runs/35042805806-experiment/`.
1b. **Emission width — measured 2026-09-16, and the surrogate lost.** The sweep ran on the six real
   held-out crops (run 35133590776): band 0 px 0.1903, 1 px 0.1525, 2 px 0.1281, 3 px 0.1128,
   4 px 0.1037, 6 px 0.0908 — monotone decreasing, so the search chose the skeleton and the earlier
   stress test (`data/evidence/shift_robustness.json`, +0.0705 for a 6-px band on a single window with
   shifted labels) does not transfer to the population the labels can actually measure. Both numbers
   are real; they answer different questions ("what if the fault is somewhere else" vs "what if it is
   where I drew it"), and the scored faults are new faults, so the truth is between them.
   *What would change the decision:* a measurement on the *scored* population — i.e. the public
   leaderboard (3 submissions/week, needs the account) — or a proxy-catalogue harness
   (item 3) that scores against faults the model never trained on. Until one of those exists, the
   skeleton stands and `--dilate-grid` stays as a documented knob. The LOO floor gain (+0.0083) is
   below the pre-registered 0.01 acceptance test: the post-processing is a small honest win, and the
   model - not the shaping - is the lever.

1c. **Emission width, third measurement — the proxy-catalogue harness answered it, and the answer
   is "widen, but not yet" (2026-09-16, session 7).** The harness of item 3 landed and was swept
   (workflow `proxy-eval`, run 35152701740, evidence `data/evidence/proxy/eval_sweep.json`). On the
   61,664 px (6,166 km) of mapped fault trace that the labels do NOT contain, the proxy DTI rises
   monotonically with the emission width: 0 px 0.0144, 1 px 0.0205, 2 px 0.0256, 3 px 0.0312,
   4 px 0.0340, 6 px 0.0395 — the sign opposite to the held-out-crop result in 1b, on the population
   that resembles the scored one. `scripts/decide_emission_width.py` reconciles the two by
   projecting each measured policy onto a range of possible scored-truth sizes |G| (the metric's
   wrong-mass term does not scale with |G|, the missing-mass term does), and writes
   `data/evidence/emission_decision.json`:

   * the 6-px band beats the shipped skeleton by **+0.0149** on the new-fault-like population
     (condition 1 of the pre-registered rule, met) and at **3/3** plausible |G| anchors — the
     GeoDAWN-blocks density anchor (≈26,000 px), the measured population (61,664 px) and the public
     catalogue (60,988 px);
   * it still *loses* below **21,328 px (2,133 km)** of scored truth, so the change is not dominant;
     a scored truth smaller than that keeps the skeleton;
   * condition 3 (reproduce on a second ensemble) is **unmet**, so the default is unchanged.

   **What this session's numbers actually demand**: a *constant-ones* submission scores 0.0585 on
   that population and beats our shipped 0.0247 and every swept candidate, because recall is worth
   4× precision under α=0.2/β=0.8. Our emission is therefore not "conservative", it is
   **under-emitting**. The next `proxy-eval` sweep must (a) extend the width grid beyond 6 px
   (8, 10, 12) since the curve is still rising, (b) add a **halo-weighted** band (weight w < 1 on the
   dilated ring instead of 1.0 — the ring earns a hit only if it lands within R, so a fractional
   weight keeps most of the recall at a fraction of the FP), and (c) re-run on a second ensemble.
   The maths for (b): a ring pixel at weight w adds w·(1 − α·DTI) if it lands within R of the truth
   and costs α·w·DTI if it does not, so the ring pays exactly when its hit rate exceeds
   α·DTI/(1 − α·DTI) ≈ 0.055 at DTI = 0.2.

2. **`neg_fraction` A/B.** Hermant et al. (2025) train only on fault-bearing tiles, explicitly to avoid
   "learning images without mapped faults when there should be some due to operator observation bias" —
   i.e. absence from the catalogue is not evidence of absence. Our config keeps 35 % empty windows.
   *Acceptance:* improve the proxy-catalogue metric (`docs/DISCOVERY_PLAN.md` §3b); a *fall* in catalogue
   DTI is acceptable and expected, because the catalogue is not the scored universe.
3. **Proxy-catalogue evaluation harness** (§3b) — **DONE 2026-09-16 (session 6-7)**: landed as
   `scripts/fetch_proxy_faults.py` → `build_proxy_catalogue.py` → `eval_proxy_catalogue.py`, ran on
   the runners (runs 35152701537, 35152701740), acceptance passed (catalogue-copy = 0.0000 on the
   absent-from-labels subset). Remaining follow-up is item 1c above. Original specification: compile independent fault traces for the GeoDAWN region
   (state geologic maps — pre-Quaternary faults are by construction absent from the Quaternary database
   used for the labels), intersect with `labels.tif`, and report DTI on the
   *present-in-proxy-but-absent-from-labels* subset. *Acceptance:* the harness reproduces the known
   result that a catalogue-copy submission scores ~0 on that subset, then discriminates between models.
4. **1 m DEM derivatives**, subset-first. Rules §2 says the DEM is part of the intended feature data and
   716 tiles are already URL-verified against the live USGS bucket (`data/dem_links.json`); Hermant et al.
   map faults from elevation and slope at 10 m. Pilot on one survey block, then decide.
5. **Every workflow step that judges a result must fail loudly.** `pipefail` is now on the steps that
   mattered; the same audit should be applied to future steps by default, and any step that writes a
   "report" should assert the thing it reports on exists and is non-degenerate.

| Emission-width question had two contradictory measurements | ✅ **third measurement built and swept** on the new-fault-like population; decision record written | `data/evidence/proxy/eval_sweep.json`, `data/evidence/emission_decision.json`, `scripts/decide_emission_width.py` |
| Truth length reported 10× short (`0.01` km/px) | ✅ **fixed** (61,664 px = 6,166 km, not 616.6 km); pinned by test | `scripts/eval_proxy_catalogue.py`, `tests/test_proxy_catalogue.py::test_eval_units_support_and_role_are_unambiguous` |
| Blanket-ones baseline changed meaning with the raster scored | ✅ **fixed** — anchored to the label footprint, source recorded, whole-grid variant kept for scale | same test |
| `as_submitted` mislabelled the sweep's soft ensemble map as a submission | ✅ **fixed** — `as_provided` + alias + `prediction_role`; sweep candidates clipped to the footprint (legal-submission scoring) | same test |
| Site had no external bar to calibrate against | ✅ **new page** `docs/verification.html`: the public leaderboard read directly, the standalone disclaimer, and every load-bearing external claim re-checked from its own URL | `data/evidence/independent_verification.json`, `tests/test_site.py` (2 new tests) |
| Emission width | ⏸️ **decided: widen, not yet** — condition 3 (second ensemble) unmet | `data/evidence/emission_decision.json` |
| Second ensemble for the width decision | ❌ **blocked on GPU + data placement** (the standing blocker) | — |

## 7. Session 2026-09-16 (review) — implemented + measured

| Item | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| LOO weight-rule audit compared across geographies (HIGH) | ✅ **removed** — weights fitted per row, no fake DTI comparison; legacy keys `None` with notes | `tests/test_ensemble.py::test_blend_loo_audit_and_dilate_grid` (updated) |
| `calibrate_shaping` 4-tuple crash with no usable folds | ✅ **fixed** — 5-tuple `(0.3, True, nan, [], 0)` | `test_calibrate_shaping_without_heldout_crops_returns_full_tuple` |
| `pre` applied twice under `--calibrate loo` (mutation) | ✅ **fixed** — copy-on-transform in both functions | `test_pre_transform_does_not_mutate_fold_crops` |
| `--weights dti` silent fallback to equal | ✅ **fixed** — WARNING printed | `test_weights_dti_falls_back_to_equal_loudly` |
| Live false "INCOMPLETE (0/0)" warning on metric.html | ✅ **fixed** — badge reads the current report schema, recounts as fallback | `tests/test_site.py` (3 tests), rebuilt `docs/metric.html` |
| `novel_component_px` disagreed with `novel_bboxes` | ✅ **fixed** — both derive from the same boxes | `test_novel_component_px_matches_bboxes_largest_first` |
| Dummy submission unseeded (reproducibility) | ✅ **fixed** — `--seed` default 42 | `test_generate_dummy_submission_is_seeded` |
| Dead `test_ds` copy per fold, dead `_weighted_mean`/`import math` | ✅ **removed** | suite still 46/46 |
| Self-falsifying pseudo-URL row | ✅ **reworded** — audit lists 0 uncatalogued hosts | `scripts/audit_docs.py` PASS |
| `/tmp` rules-URL leak + stale link counts on other pages | ⏸️ **left to sibling branch** (already fixed there; same-hunk conflict avoided) | `arena/01a0ab54-gemsdoe` diff reviewed 2026-09-16 |

### 7.1 Queued next (in order — for this session's follow-up or the next)

1. **Read the dilate-ab verdict** (run 35133590776, still running at session end): keep a wider
   emission band only if the LOO mean beats the skeleton by > 0.01. **Disregard that run's
   `weight_rule_gain`** — it was computed by the removed cross-geography comparison.
2. **Sound LOO weight audit (footprint intersection).** Each fold manifest already saves
   `test_windows`; intersect them across folds, combine the full-raster `prob_raw.tif` maps on the
   intersection with each candidate weight rule, score there. *Acceptance:* the audit reproduces
   the known full-map result (equal ≈ weighted-or-better on 6 folds) before it is trusted to
   choose anything.
3. **`neg_fraction` A/B** (carried): Hermant et al. train only on fault-bearing tiles; we keep 35 %
   empty windows. *Acceptance:* proxy-catalogue metric (§3b), not catalogue DTI.
4. **Proxy-catalogue harness** (carried, §3b): independent traces ∩ `labels.tif`, DTI on the
   present-in-proxy-but-absent-from-labels subset; must first reproduce "catalogue copy ≈ 0".
5. **1 m DEM pilot** (carried): one survey block of derivatives; rules §2 admits the DEM as feature
   data, tiles verified.
6. **Merge coordination:** after the sibling branch merges (verify/links/site pipeline + Tests
   workflow), re-run verify-sources once on main so every page renders from one evidence set; then
   confirm the Tests workflow passes on main with this session's 8 new tests.
8. **Human-only (unchanged):** DrivenData account + enrolment, first upload (3/week), eligibility
   check (§1.3), Pages source setting (legacy-vs-Actions race still open), generative-AI + code
   assets at the deadline.

## Session 23 — suggestions implemented, and one for next time

| # | Suggestion | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Let the site produce the artifact, not just describe it.** The submit dialog wants a file; every previous route required a clone, Python and GDAL. | ✅ Implemented — `docs/geotiff_writer.js` + `docs/generate_submission.js` + `docs/submission_meta.json`/`submission_field.bin`, mounted as §3 of `docs/how_to_submit.html`. No dependency, no network, self-checked before download. |
| 2 | **Give the CLI and CI the same exit condition as the page.** | ✅ `scripts/build_submission_payload.py --check/--verify`, `scripts/check_site_generator.py` (now gate 9 of the readiness check), `scripts/package_submission.py --check`, `.github/workflows/make-submission.yml` with a 100,000-byte stub guard. |
| 3 | **A harness must be able to see the page's own state machine.** Unit tests on the writer passed while the glue still failed the first click. | ✅ `tests/support/generator_ui_harness.js` drives the real `generate_submission.js` against a shimmed DOM with Node's real `Blob`/`Response`/`CompressionStream`, in `tif`/`zip`/`broken` modes; the `broken` mode asserts the download is withheld. |
| 4 | **Refuse to write rather than write and warn.** | ✅ The writer CLI exits 1 and leaves no `.tif`/`.zip` on disk when any check fails; the page never triggers the anchor click. |
| 5 | **Render "stale" instead of pretending.** | ✅ `build_site.py` compares the manifest's pinned artifact hash with the artifact in the tree and prints `IN SYNC` / `STALE`; the generator section disappears (does not fake a green) when the payload files are absent. |
| 6 | Run `make-submission.yml` once on a real runner and read its committed evidence. | ⏳ Open — the file has never executed; the 11 structure tests in `tests/test_make_submission_workflow.py` are not a substitute for one green run. Push a commit touching `.github/triggers/make-submission`, or `gh workflow run make-submission.yml -f route=adopted -f package=both`. |
| 7 | Consider a "Build it here" link from the site root. | ⏳ Open, cosmetic — today the generator is reachable only from `how_to_submit.html`. |
